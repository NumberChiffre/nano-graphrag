Students galvanized by the deadly mass shooting at the Florida high school confronted lawmakers with demands to restrict sales of assault rifles, while President Donald Trump suggested arming teachers as a way to stop more U.S. rampages.\\nTwo weeks before a gunman fatally shot 17 people at a Florida high school, Bill Lee, the president of the state’s school administrators association, warned that Florida’s schools were vulnerable to just such an attack. “It’s not a matter of if, but when,” he wrote in the Orlando Sentinel on Jan. 29, calling on legislators to increase school security spending after two January school shootings in other states.\\nWorld\\nU.S. players pose for a photo as they celebrate their victory over Canada.

The real strategic winner, however, is the South Korean government, which has shrewdly used the games to reshape the diplomatic landscape.”\\nBusiness\\nLast March, executives at General Electric's power-plant business gave Wall Street a surprisingly bullish forecast for the year. Despite flat demand for new natural gas power plants, they said, GE Power’s revenue and profit would rise.

(NYSE American:TRXC), a medical device company that is digitizing the interface between the surgeon and the patient to improve minimally invasive surgery, today announced that the Company has received FDA 510(k) clearance for expanded indications of its Senhance Surgical System.\\nThe Company received FDA 510(k) clearance for laparoscopic inguinal hernia and laparoscopic cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) surgery. There are approximately 760,000 inguinal hernia and 1.2 million laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures performed annually in the U.S. With this clearance, Senhance System\\'s total addressable annual procedures in the U.S. has more than doubled to over three million.\\n“This indication expansion immediately doubles the addressable market for Senhance in the US and validates our regulatory strategy to successfully add to our indications for use,” said Todd M. Pope, president and chief executive officer of TransEnterix. “These expanded procedures are commonly performed at over 95% of hospitals in the United States. We believe this indication expansion will significantly increase the applicability of Senhance to more institutions, particularly those with a busy general surgery practice.”\\nIn the U.S., Senhance is now cleared for laparoscopic colorectal, gynecologic, inguinal hernia and cholecystectomy surgery. This enables Senhance to be used for some of the most common abdominal surgeries, including procedures in general surgery and gynecology.\\n“We have utilized Senhance broadly across a wide range of general surgery, upper GI surgery and colorectal procedures at our institution,” said Professor Dr. Frank Willeke, Chief of Surgery at St. Marien Hospital in Siegen, Germany. “We believe this procedural expansion for the US will allow surgeons there to incorporate the Senhance, as we have, as a highly-efficient, enabling and very promising technology that can impact the vast majority of surgeries commonly performed by general surgeons and their sub-specialties.”\\nAbout TransEnterix\\nTransEnterix is a medical device company that is digitizing the interface between the surgeon and the patient to improve minimally invasive surgery by addressing the clinical and economic challenges associated with current laparoscopic and robotic options in today\\'s value-based healthcare environment. The Company is focused on the commercialization of the Senhance Surgical System, which digitizes laparoscopic minimally invasive surgery.

Germany\\'s 10-year bond yield rose to an almost 5-week high as a surge in oil prices increased inflation expectations. Polish and Hungarian bonds tracked a steepening Bund yield curve. Poland\\'s 10-year yield rose 2 basis points (bps) from Thursday\\'s close to 3.061, and Hungary\\'s equivalent yield, at 2.49 percent, was 3 bps above Thursday\\'s fixing. Hungary\\'s advance was not linked with either gross wages data which again showed double-digit annual growth or new comments from Prime Minister Viktor Orban highlighting tension with Brussels, market participants said. The surge in wages is unlikely to boost inflation in the short term and lead to less loose central bank policy, analysts said. Markets continue to ignore an East-West divide in the European Union over differences in views about immigration and the role of national governments, one Budapest-based fixed income trader said. \"We are yet to see if the jostling turns into a street fight,\" the trader said. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Friday that EU leaders should not make sweeping decisions on migration before next year\\'s European Parliament elections. Hungary\\'s forint eased 0.1 percent against the euro by 0902 GMT, just like the zloty and the leu , while regional stock markets were mixed. The region\\'s currencies are still near the 2-month highs they reached by early this week as investors chose Central European currencies and bonds instead of other emerging markets, which were hit by jitters, like Russia and Turkey. The dinar firmed slightly to 118.05 ahead of an auction of 3-year Serbian government bonds. Auctions this year often buoyed the dinar which has also been strengthened by increased demand for lending, FDI inflows and robust exports. The Serbian central bank repeatedly sold the currency which remains resistant even though the bank last week surprised at its second consecutive rate-setting meeting by reducing its benchmark rate. \"Although market demand at the debt auction is likely to be good, strong RSD may raise more concerns with the regulator (central bank) so a possibility of FX interventions should not be ruled out,\" Raiffeisen analyst Gintaras Shlizhyus said in a note.

On Thursday, U.S. stocks rose to pare the week’s losses .\\nAs 10-year U.S. Treasury yields have ticked higher this year, equity investors are watching bond markets closely for signs that higher yields are affecting corporate performance.\\n“Historically, the probability of loss for the S&P 500 increases when the 10-year Treasury yield rises above 3%,” said Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists in a research note this week.\\nIn midday trading in Europe, U.S. 10-year Treasury yields dipped slightly from their levels Thursday, to 2.89%. That benchmark yield has risen from 2.4% at the end of 2017.\\nBoards displaying stock information at the Australian Securities Exchange in Sydney early this month. Photo: Brendon Thorne/Bloomberg News Ten-year Treasury yields haven’t risen above 3% for four years, and even then yields only rose to such levels briefly.\\n“There’s been a generation of market participants that haven’t really seen a rising rate environment,” said Lyn Graham-Taylor, senior rates strategist at Rabobank.\\n“You’ve seen a lot of products and leverage, as has become clear in the past month, that has been built up by the hunt for yield and a long period of easy monetary policy,” he added.\\nThe autos and parts sector of the Stoxx 600 was among the worst performing, falling 0.9%. Automotive supplier Valeo SA was among the worst performing stocks on the index, falling 11% after announcing a 2017 decline in net profit.\\nIn European bond markets, German government bond yields continued to tick lower. 10-year bund yields fell to around 0.66%, from around 0.71% Thursday.\\nSolid stock gains were seen in many parts of Asia-Pacific. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was recently up 1%, and a gauge of Chinese companies with listings in the city climbed 2%.\\nAustralia’s S&P/ASX 200 closed 0.8% higher to cap its best week since October, and a 1.5% rise gave South Korea’s Kospi its best day since Oct. 10.\\nChina’s Shenzen A-Share index was up 0.2%.\\n“Asia is in a good position to ride out interest-rates hikes from the Federal Reserve given the prospects of a weaker dollar and a solid outlook for Asian exports,” said Christy Tan, head of markets strategy/research for Asia at National Australia Bank .\\nIn foreign exchange markets, the greenback strengthened slightly, with the WSJ Dollar Index up 0.1%.\\nOil prices sipped slightly, with Brent crude down 0.5% to $66.06 a barrel, and WTI down 0.4% to $62.50 a barrel.\\nWrite to Mike Bird at Mike.Bird@wsj.com', 'entities': [{'entity_name': 'GLOBAL STOCK MARKETS', 'entity_type': 'EVENT', 'description': 'The overall state of stock markets worldwide, which

       " Example({'input_text': 'WASHINGTON, April 9 (Reuters) - Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg\\'s No. 1 mission during his appearance before U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday and Wednesday will be to defend against calls to regulate internet-based companies.\\nThe prospect of new laws that restrict Facebook and other internet companies, however, is extremely unlikely not only because of a lack of political will and the effective lobbying of technology companies but because few lawmakers want to grapple with the sheer complexity of the technical issues involved.\\nZuckerberg is scheduled to testify before a joint hearing of the Senate Commerce and Judiciary Committees.\\nHe is confronting combined outrage over how Russia used Facebook to spread divisive political propaganda during the 2016 U.S. presidential election and how Facebook seemed unaware that a political consultancy, Cambridge Analytica, improperly harvested personal data of about 87 million Facebook users, most of them Americans.\\nSenator Bill Nelson, the top Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee, said on Monday that while he believed new regulation was needed in the face of Facebook\\'s twin scandals, he did not expect anything substantive to happen.\\nHe attributed that in part to the format for Tuesday\\'s joint hearing before the Senate\\'s Commerce and Judiciary committees that will give Zuckerberg an advantage, saying it would favor spectacle over thoughtful dialogue.\\n\"How in the world can you have 44 senators do a hearing that has a lot of substance when each senator only has four minutes?\" Nelson asked reporters on Monday.\\nSenator Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, told reporters after speaking with 33-year-old Zuckerberg, that he \"was a very nice young man\" who \"obviously knows what he\\'s doing and has a very pleasant personality.\"\\nPRIVACY ADVOCATES OUTNUMBERED\\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders declined to say on Monday if new regulations were needed. I don\\'t have a specific policy announcement on that front, but I think we\\'re all looking forward to that testimony.\\nRepublicans are generally against more corporate regulation and they are not persuaded that tech companies need more of it. I dont want to hurt Facebook. I dont want to regulate them half to death, said Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana, a member of the Judiciary Committee But we have a problem. Our promised digital utopia has minefields in it.\\nCompanies that have been victimized by computer hacks have been accused by lawmakers of failing to take adequate security measures to protect their customers\\' personal information.\\nSenior executives from a host of companies including Target Corp, Alphabet\\'s Google, United Airlines and Equifax, have testified before Congress on a variety of issues including network security and walked away with little more than a scolding and a temporary dip in stock price.\\nPowerful lobbying forces assemble against any effort to convert public and political outrage into regulation, privacy advocates have said. Facebook spent $1.35 million on lobbying in 2011 and six years later spent $11.5 million, according to data maintained by the Center for Responsive Politics.\\n\"People have this idea that we are going to pass omnibus privacy legislation and it is going to be a silver bullet,\" said Alvaro Bedoya, a former congressional aide who worked on privacy issues for former Senator Al Franken. \"The reality is lobbyists outnumber consumer privacy advocates in Washington 20 to 1 or 30 to 1.\"\\nInstead of major regulatory changes, lawmakers in Congress have offered narrowly focused legislation.\\nThe Honest Ads Act, for instance, aims to address concerns about foreign nationals covertly purchasing ads on social media to influence American politics. It would require political ads on the internet to reveal who paid for them, much the same as ads on television and radio. It legislation has been stalled since its introduction last October, although Facebook endorsed it on Friday.\\nCongress did pass legislation last month that chipped away at the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which for decades has guarded internet-based companies from liability for what users post on their platforms.\\nThe legislation, which is expected to be signed into law this week by U.S. President Donald Trump, was aimed at penalizing operators of websites that facilitate online sex trafficking. Internet companies have expressed worry that it could be the first step toward dismantling decades of a hands-off regulatory approach by Washington.\\nTechnology industry officials said they also expected Zuckerberg\\'s testimony to be long on political point scoring and short on legislative ideas.\\n\"They don\\'t understand ad targeting and they will probably ask him a bunch of unrelated questions that play to their respective political bases,\" said one technology industry source, who spoke on condition on anonymity because his company had not authorized him to speak on the matter for the record.\\n\"So Democrats will ask about monopolies and Republicans will ask about anti-conservative bias in Silicon Valley.\" (Reporting by Dustin Volz in Washington Additional reporting by David Ingram, David Shepardson and Amanda Becker)', 'entities': [{'entity_name': 'MARK ZUCKERBERG', 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'description': \"Facebook Chief Executive, scheduled to testify before the Senate Commerce and Judiciary Committees.

Around 75 percent of its leather goods now cost just under 1,000 pounds ($1,400), or less.\\nIn spite of a tougher balancing act on costs, Mulberry was “fully, fully committed” to Britain, Andretta added, speaking on Monday.\\nThe label - whose bags have been sported by celebrities including Prince Harry’s fiancee, actress Meghan Markle - trades off its UK heritage and the skills of its craftsmen.\\n“We want to continue this and I hope one day when we grow perhaps we will even consider opening another factory,” said Andretta, who used to run Italian fine jewellers Buccellati and has worked at labels like LVMH’s Celine.\\nManufacturing bases outside Britain include Italy and Spain.\\nDIGITAL GENERATION The brand is expanding sales overseas, branching into Japan with a partner.\\nMulberry’s like-for-like retail sales, which compares stores that have been trading for a year or more, were down 1 percent in the United Kingdom in the six months to end-September and fell 3 percent overseas in that period. But international revenue growth sped up thereafter.\\nThe label, majority-owned by Singapore billionaires Christina Ong and Ong Beng Seng, will roll out a China-based distribution centre later in 2018 to help it expand online shopping and speed up deliveries, Andretta said.\\nRevived spending from Chinese consumers, who account for around a third of luxury goods purchases worldwide, fuelled strong revenue growth at industry leaders like Louis Vuitton owner LVMH in 2017.\\nMulberry is also trying to capture a younger clientele with updated designs and strategies. From February, its catwalk collections will be instantly available, rather than months later as is usual.\\nNew designs like the Amberley bag and a revamped version of the brand’s classic Bayswater are now among bestsellers, Andretta said.\\n“We are growing strongly with the digital generation,” Andretta said. Sales of older bag models were slowing slightly, offset by growth in newer versions, he added. “The younger consumer is moving to the modern version of Mulberry.”\\n$1 = 0.7104 pounds Editing by Adrian Croft\\n ', 'entities': [{'entity_name': 'MULBERRY', 'entity_type': 'ORGANIZATION', 'description': 'A handbag maker committed to manufacturing in Britain, facing higher leather import costs post-Brexit.

It uses a language model to identify entities of specified types and to describe the relationships among these entities in detail. The program enforces type annotations and validates the output to ensure accuracy and consistency. The extracted entities and relationships are returned in a structured format, with detailed descriptions and attributes for each entity and relationship. The program also includes mechanisms to retry and correct errors in the output, ensuring robustness in the extraction process.\n"

      "\"There is an alliance between Israel and other countries in the Middle East that would have been unimaginable years ago. I've never seen anything like it in my lifetime,\" he said Thursday on panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n",
      "Netanyahu ripped into the Iran nuclear deal , stressing that many countries, particularly in the Arab world, agree with him.\n",
      "\"If Iran tries to rush for a bomb, there are many countries that will not let them,\" the prime minister said. \"We would not let them acquire a nuclear weapon. There are Arab states, unnamed, that agree with me.\"\n",
      "The Iran deal or the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), enacted in 2015 by Iran, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council — China, France, Russia, the U.K. and the U.S. — and Germany, allowed the lifting of international sanctions on Iran in exchange for compliance with restrictions on its nuclear program.\n",
      "The UN's International Atomic Energy Agency confirms Iran is complying with the deal's rules, while its European signatories have praised it, saying it brought more stability to the region and averted a potential nuclear war.\n",
      "Israel and Saudi Arabia were some of the deal's most prominent opponents.\n",
      "The result has been a growing strategic alliance — one that has reportedly gone back for several years — between Israel, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, and it's become closer than at any point in the region's history.\n",
      "\"It is an extraordinary thing — it starts with a common concern, a common enemy, which is extremist Islam and terrorism, both Sunni and Shia extremism,\" Netanyahu said.\n",
      "\"Also,\" he said, \"Our common stance against Iran.\"\n",
      "And there was another source of this closeness, the prime minister said. \"It's the desire (of Arab states) to make use of the civilian technology in Israel has — in health, agriculture, water, energy — to better the lives of their citizens.\"\n",
      "\"I view that as a great promise of peace,\" he said. \"We see the beginning of changes in the attitudes toward Israel of (Arab) publics — not all of it, but a significant minority. That is hope, that is the future of peace, and that could mean the Palestinians too.\"\n",
      "The comments come against a backdrop of ever-heating regional tensions between the Sunni Muslim Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Shiite Muslim-dominated Iran, and amid continued anger across the Arab world at U.S. President Donald Trump's decision in December to name Jerusalem as the Israeli capital .\n",

      "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Nokia is introducing new silicon chipsets for running next-generation 5G wireless networks that promise to cut antenna size in half, triple data-handling capacity and cut the power consumption of mobile towers, the company said on Monday. \n",
      "The chipsets, known as ReefShark, are expected to ship in volume during the third quarter of 2018 and can be inserted into Nokia’s existing AirScale family of 4G and 5G-ready network gear, the world’s No.2 maker of mobile network gear said. \n",
      "Nokia said it is working with 30 mobile operators to deploy the new chipsets into their wireless towers, meaning that the first networks could be upgraded later this year, with mass-market deployments to follow as 5G-ready devices hit the market. \n",
      "ReefShark chipsets are designed to work in so-called Massive MIMO antennas that are able to send and receive dozens of separate streams of data, offering many times more network capacity and greater wireless coverage from a single cell tower. \n",
      "The chipsets will allow the size of antennas, on average, to be cut in half to as small as 45 centimetres (18 inches) tall from existing antennas that currently range in size from 1 metre (3.3 ft) to 2.6 metres tall, enabling them to be installed in far more locations.

      "PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The program is designed to solve the task of entity and relationship extraction from text documents. It works by first identifying entities of specified types within the input text, then detailing each entity comprehensively, including its role, attributes, relationships, and notable actions. Next, it identifies and describes relationships between these entities, detailing the nature, impact, and evolution of each relationship, including direct and higher-order relationships. Finally, it compiles all extracted entities and relationships into a structured JSON object following a specified schema.\n",

      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the entities_relationships. We first identify the entities in the text based on the provided entity types. From the text, we can extract entities such as \"Trump\" (PERSON), \"White House\" (ORGANIZATION), \"Ronny Jackson\" (PERSON), \"Department of Veterans Affairs\" (ORGANIZATION), \"CNBC\" (ORGANIZATION), \"Kayla Tausche\" (PERSON), \"Rear Admiral\" (TITLE), \"2 Hours Ago\" (TIME). We then analyze the relationships between these entities. For example, \"Trump\" has a direct relationship with \"Ronny Jackson\" as he \"tapped\" him for a new role. Similarly, \"Ronny Jackson\" has a direct relationship with \"Department of Veterans Affairs\" as he is to run it. We also identify higher-order relationships, such as the indirect effect of \"Trump\" tapping \"Ronny Jackson\" on the \"White House\" shakeup. Finally, we compile these entities and relationships into a JSON object following the specified schema.\n",

      "The Iran deal or the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), enacted in 2015 by Iran, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council — China, France, Russia, the U.K. and the U.S. — and Germany, allowed the lifting of international sanctions on Iran in exchange for compliance with restrictions on its nuclear program.\n",

      "\"Also,\" he said, \"Our common stance against Iran.\"\n",
      "And there was another source of this closeness, the prime minister said. \"It's the desire (of Arab states) to make use of the civilian technology in Israel has — in health, agriculture, water, energy — to better the lives of their citizens.\"\n",
      "\"I view that as a great promise of peace,\" he said. \"We see the beginning of changes in the attitudes toward Israel of (Arab) publics — not all of it, but a significant minority. That is hope, that is the future of peace, and that could mean the Palestinians too.\"\n",
      "The comments come against a backdrop of ever-heating regional tensions between the Sunni Muslim Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Shiite Muslim-dominated Iran, and amid continued anger across the Arab world at U.S. President Donald Trump's decision in December to name Jerusalem as the Israeli capital .\n",

      "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Nokia is introducing new silicon chipsets for running next-generation 5G wireless networks that promise to cut antenna size in half, triple data-handling capacity and cut the power consumption of mobile towers, the company said on Monday. \n",
      "The chipsets, known as ReefShark, are expected to ship in volume during the third quarter of 2018 and can be inserted into Nokia’s existing AirScale family of 4G and 5G-ready network gear, the world’s No.2 maker of mobile network gear said. \n",
      "Nokia said it is working with 30 mobile operators to deploy the new chipsets into their wireless towers, meaning that the first networks could be upgraded later this year, with mass-market deployments to follow as 5G-ready devices hit the market. \n",
      "ReefShark chipsets are designed to work in so-called Massive MIMO antennas that are able to send and receive dozens of separate streams of data, offering many times more network capacity and greater wireless coverage from a single cell tower. \n",
      "The chipsets will allow the size of antennas, on average, to be cut in half to as small as 45 centimetres (18 inches) tall from existing antennas that currently range in size from 1 metre (3.3 ft) to 2.6 metres tall, enabling them to be installed in far more locations.

      "Input Text: LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s economy was weaker than previously thought in 2017, official data showed on Thursday, leaving the country lagging further behind the global recovery as it prepares to leave the European Union.\n",
      "The downgrade of the full-year and fourth-quarter growth rates also raised questions about the strength of the economy as the Bank of England prepares to raise interest rates.\n",
      "Gross domestic product growth slowed to a quarterly 0.4 percent from a previous estimate of 0.5 percent, wrong-footing economists and reducing 2017 growth as a whole to 1.7 percent, its lowest since 2012.\n",
      "Related Coverage UK retail sales growth eases further in February: CBI This was still stronger than most economists feared immediately after Britain voted to leave the EU in June 2016.\n",
      "But the country has relied heavily on the unexpectedly robust global economy to sustain its economic growth while consumers have been squeezed by higher inflation caused by the fall in the pound after the Brexit vote.\n",
      "Sterling was little changed after Thursday’s data and government bond prices rose slightly.\n",
      "Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank, said the figures showed Britain’s economy was growing at roughly the pace the BoE sees its new, lower speed limit, meaning a rate hike was still on the cards.\n",
      "But Samuel Tombs, at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the data showed the central bank should delay any action for now.\n",
      "“The latest GDP data suggest that the economy remains in a fragile state and does not need to be cooled with another rate rise as soon as May,” he said in a note to clients.\n",
      "BoE Governor Mark Carney said this month that rates would probably need to rise sooner and by somewhat more than the central bank had thought in November, when it raised borrowing costs for the first time in a decade.\n",
      "Most economists think rates will rise again in May, and financial markets expect a further increase, to 1 percent, by the end of the year.\n",
      "LAGGARD UK Britain’s year-on-year economic growth of 1.4 percent in the last three months of 2017 was not just its weakest in five years but also the weakest of any of the economies in the Group of Seven, including long-term laggards such as Japan and Italy.\n",
      "There were only limited signs of a rebalancing of the economy away from consumer demand and toward business investment and net trade that Carney pointed to as positive signs in an appearance before lawmakers on Wednesday.\n",
      "Business investment was flat on the quarter and 2.1 percent higher on the year, both readings coming in weaker than expected in a Reuters poll of economists. Net trade dragged on growth in most quarters of 2017, though it was positive on the year.\n",
      "The BoE said earlier this month that it expected the economy would grow by 1.8 percent this year, faster than its previous forecast of 1.6 percent, mostly because of the strength of the global economy.\n",

      "PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The program is designed to solve the task of entity and relationship extraction from text documents. It works by first identifying entities within the text based on a provided list of entity types. Each entity is described in detail, including its role, attributes, relationships to other entities, and any notable actions or events associated with it. Next, the program identifies relationships between the extracted entities, detailing the nature of the relationship, its impact, and any historical or contextual information relevant to the relationship. The program ensures that both direct and higher-order relationships (second and third order) are captured. Finally, the program compiles all extracted entities and relationships into a structured JSON format, adhering strictly to the provided entity types and relationship schema.\n",

      "Input Text: As students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School confront lawmakers with demands to restrict sales of assault rifles, there were warnings by the president of the Florida school administration association that schools in the state were vulnerable to such an attack.\n",
      "Highlights\n",
      "“Nikolas Cruz was able to purchase an assault rifle before he was able to buy a beer,” said Stoneman Douglas student Laurenzo Prado, referring to a Florida law that allows people as young as 18 to buy assault weapons. Students galvanized by the deadly mass shooting at the Florida high school confronted lawmakers with demands to restrict sales of assault rifles, while President Donald Trump suggested arming teachers as a way to stop more U.S. rampages.\n",
      "Two weeks before a gunman fatally shot 17 people at a Florida high school, Bill Lee, the president of the state’s school administrators association, warned that Florida’s schools were vulnerable to just such an attack. “It’s not a matter of if, but when,” he wrote in the Orlando Sentinel on Jan. 29, calling on legislators to increase school security spending after two January school shootings in other states.\n",

      "Commentary\n",
      "North Korea’s participation in the 2018 Winter Olympics has created an opening for renewed dialogue with the United States and South Korea, writes Peter App s. “By taking part so visibly alongside South Korea, Pyongyang has been able to present itself as a credible global and regional power in a way that has eluded North Korean leaders since the war that divided the peninsula. The real strategic winner, however, is the South Korean government, which has shrewdly used the games to reshape the diplomatic landscape.”\n",

      "Last March, executives at General Electric's power-plant business gave Wall Street a surprisingly bullish forecast for the year. Despite flat demand for new natural gas power plants, they said, GE Power’s revenue and profit would rise. But GE’s forecast turned out to be a mirage .\n",

      "Input Text: LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s economy was weaker than previously thought in 2017, official data showed on Thursday, leaving the country lagging further behind the global recovery as it prepares to leave the European Union.\n",
      "The downgrade of the full-year and fourth-quarter growth rates also raised questions about the strength of the economy as the Bank of England prepares to raise interest rates.\n",
      "Gross domestic product growth slowed to a quarterly 0.4 percent from a previous estimate of 0.5 percent, wrong-footing economists and reducing 2017 growth as a whole to 1.7 percent, its lowest since 2012.\n",
      "Related Coverage UK retail sales growth eases further in February: CBI This was still stronger than most economists feared immediately after Britain voted to leave the EU in June 2016.\n",
      "But the country has relied heavily on the unexpectedly robust global economy to sustain its economic growth while consumers have been squeezed by higher inflation caused by the fall in the pound after the Brexit vote.\n",
      "Sterling was little changed after Thursday’s data and government bond prices rose slightly.\n",
      "Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank, said the figures showed Britain’s economy was growing at roughly the pace the BoE sees its new, lower speed limit, meaning a rate hike was still on the cards.\n",
      "But Samuel Tombs, at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the data showed the central bank should delay any action for now.\n",
      "“The latest GDP data suggest that the economy remains in a fragile state and does not need to be cooled with another rate rise as soon as May,” he said in a note to clients.\n",
      "BoE Governor Mark Carney said this month that rates would probably need to rise sooner and by somewhat more than the central bank had thought in November, when it raised borrowing costs for the first time in a decade.\n",
      "Most economists think rates will rise again in May, and financial markets expect a further increase, to 1 percent, by the end of the year.\n",
      "LAGGARD UK Britain’s year-on-year economic growth of 1.4 percent in the last three months of 2017 was not just its weakest in five years but also the weakest of any of the economies in the Group of Seven, including long-term laggards such as Japan and Italy.\n",
      "There were only limited signs of a rebalancing of the economy away from consumer demand and toward business investment and net trade that Carney pointed to as positive signs in an appearance before lawmakers on Wednesday.\n",
      "Business investment was flat on the quarter and 2.1 percent higher on the year, both readings coming in weaker than expected in a Reuters poll of economists. Net trade dragged on growth in most quarters of 2017, though it was positive on the year.\n",
      "The BoE said earlier this month that it expected the economy would grow by 1.8 percent this year, faster than its previous forecast of 1.6 percent, mostly because of the strength of the global economy.\n",

      "task_demos Input Text: As students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School confront lawmakers with demands to restrict sales of assault rifles, there were warnings by the president of the Florida school administration association that schools in the state were vulnerable to such an attack.\n",
      "Highlights\n",
      "“Nikolas Cruz was able to purchase an assault rifle before he was able to buy a beer,” said Stoneman Douglas student Laurenzo Prado, referring to a Florida law that allows people as young as 18 to buy assault weapons. Students galvanized by the deadly mass shooting at the Florida high school confronted lawmakers with demands to restrict sales of assault rifles, while President Donald Trump suggested arming teachers as a way to stop more U.S. rampages.\n",
      "Two weeks before a gunman fatally shot 17 people at a Florida high school, Bill Lee, the president of the state’s school administrators association, warned that Florida’s schools were vulnerable to just such an attack. “It’s not a matter of if, but when,” he wrote in the Orlando Sentinel on Jan. 29, calling on legislators to increase school security spending after two January school shootings in other states.\n",

      "North Korea’s participation in the 2018 Winter Olympics has created an opening for renewed dialogue with the United States and South Korea, writes Peter App s. “By taking part so visibly alongside South Korea, Pyongyang has been able to present itself as a credible global and regional power in a way that has eluded North Korean leaders since the war that divided the peninsula. The real strategic winner, however, is the South Korean government, which has shrewdly used the games to reshape the diplomatic landscape.”\n",

      "Last March, executives at General Electric's power-plant business gave Wall Street a surprisingly bullish forecast for the year. Despite flat demand for new natural gas power plants, they said, GE Power’s revenue and profit would rise. But GE’s forecast turned out to be a mirage .\n",

      "Input Text: * Polish, Hungarian bonds track steepening Bund yield curve * Investors ignore Hungarian wage data, CEE tension with Brussels * Serbia's 2021-expiry bond auction seen drawing strong demand By Sandor Peto BUDAPEST, April 20 (Reuters) - Long-term yields in some Central European markets tracked a rise in euro zone peers on Friday, while a 3-year bond auction in Serbia was expected to draw strong demand. Germany's 10-year bond yield rose to an almost 5-week high as a surge in oil prices increased inflation expectations. Polish and Hungarian bonds tracked a steepening Bund yield curve. Poland's 10-year yield rose 2 basis points (bps) from Thursday's close to 3.061, and Hungary's equivalent yield, at 2.49 percent, was 3 bps above Thursday's fixing. Hungary's advance was not linked with either gross wages data which again showed double-digit annual growth or new comments from Prime Minister Viktor Orban highlighting tension with Brussels, market participants said. The surge in wages is unlikely to boost inflation in the short term and lead to less loose central bank policy, analysts said. Markets continue to ignore an East-West divide in the European Union over differences in views about immigration and the role of national governments, one Budapest-based fixed income trader said. \"We are yet to see if the jostling turns into a street fight,\" the trader said. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Friday that EU leaders should not make sweeping decisions on migration before next year's European Parliament elections. Hungary's forint eased 0.1 percent against the euro by 0902 GMT, just like the zloty and the leu , while regional stock markets were mixed. The region's currencies are still near the 2-month highs they reached by early this week as investors chose Central European currencies and bonds instead of other emerging markets, which were hit by jitters, like Russia and Turkey. The dinar firmed slightly to 118.05 ahead of an auction of 3-year Serbian government bonds. Auctions this year often buoyed the dinar which has also been strengthened by increased demand for lending, FDI inflows and robust exports. The Serbian central bank repeatedly sold the currency which remains resistant even though the bank last week surprised at its second consecutive rate-setting meeting by reducing its benchmark rate. \"Although market demand at the debt auction is likely to be good, strong RSD may raise more concerns with the regulator (central bank) so a possibility of FX interventions should not be ruled out,\" Raiffeisen analyst Gintaras Shlizhyus said in a note.

      "PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The program is designed to solve the task of entity and relationship extraction from text documents. It works by taking an input text and a list of entity types, then identifying all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities. The program ensures detailed and comprehensive descriptions for each entity, including their roles, attributes, relationships, and significance. For relationships, it provides detailed descriptions, including the nature, impact, and historical context of the relationships. The program also includes direct and higher-order relationships, ensuring that the \"src_id\" and \"tgt_id\" fields match the entity names exactly. Finally, it compiles all this information into a JSON object following a specified schema.\n",

      "Input Text: As students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School confront lawmakers with demands to restrict sales of assault rifles, there were warnings by the president of the Florida school administration association that schools in the state were vulnerable to such an attack.\n",
      "Highlights\n",
      "“Nikolas Cruz was able to purchase an assault rifle before he was able to buy a beer,” said Stoneman Douglas student Laurenzo Prado, referring to a Florida law that allows people as young as 18 to buy assault weapons. Students galvanized by the deadly mass shooting at the Florida high school confronted lawmakers with demands to restrict sales of assault rifles, while President Donald Trump suggested arming teachers as a way to stop more U.S. rampages.\n",
      "Two weeks before a gunman fatally shot 17 people at a Florida high school, Bill Lee, the president of the state’s school administrators association, warned that Florida’s schools were vulnerable to just such an attack. “It’s not a matter of if, but when,” he wrote in the Orlando Sentinel on Jan. 29, calling on legislators to increase school security spending after two January school shootings in other states.\n",

      "U.S. players pose for a photo as they celebrate their victory over Canada. REUTERS/Grigory Dukor She’s practiced the ‘Oops, I did it again’ thousands of times in training, and her signature trick was worth its weight in Olympic gold as American Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson’s shootout winner broke a Canadian 16-year stranglehold on the women’s ice hockey title. It was the perfect jaw-dropping finale to a game that was billed as a grudge match but swiftly developed into a classic for the ages at the Pyeongchang Winter Games.\n",
      "Warplanes pounded the last rebel enclave near the Syrian capital for a fifth straight day, as the United Nations pleaded for a truce to halt one of the fiercest air assaults of the seven-year civil war and prevent a “massacre” .\n",
      "Bangladesh is racing to turn an uninhabited and muddy Bay of Bengal island into home for 100,000 Rohingya Muslims who have fled a military crackdown in Myanmar , amid conflicting signals from top Bangladeshi officials about whether the refugees would end up being stranded there.\n",
      "Commentary\n",
      "North Korea’s participation in the 2018 Winter Olympics has created an opening for renewed dialogue with the United States and South Korea, writes Peter App s. “By taking part so visibly alongside South Korea, Pyongyang has been able to present itself as a credible global and regional power in a way that has eluded North Korean leaders since the war that divided the peninsula. The real strategic winner, however, is the South Korean government, which has shrewdly used the games to reshape the diplomatic landscape.”\n",
      "Business\n",
      "Last March, executives at General Electric's power-plant business gave Wall Street a surprisingly bullish forecast for the year. Despite flat demand for new natural gas power plants, they said, GE Power’s revenue and profit would rise. But GE’s forecast turned out to be a mirage .\n",
      "Mexican buyers imported ten times more corn from Brazil last year amid concern that NAFTA renegotiations could disrupt their U.S. supplies, according to government data and top grains merchants.\n",

      "Input Text: * Polish, Hungarian bonds track steepening Bund yield curve * Investors ignore Hungarian wage data, CEE tension with Brussels * Serbia's 2021-expiry bond auction seen drawing strong demand By Sandor Peto BUDAPEST, April 20 (Reuters) - Long-term yields in some Central European markets tracked a rise in euro zone peers on Friday, while a 3-year bond auction in Serbia was expected to draw strong demand. Germany's 10-year bond yield rose to an almost 5-week high as a surge in oil prices increased inflation expectations. Polish and Hungarian bonds tracked a steepening Bund yield curve. Poland's 10-year yield rose 2 basis points (bps) from Thursday's close to 3.061, and Hungary's equivalent yield, at 2.49 percent, was 3 bps above Thursday's fixing. Hungary's advance was not linked with either gross wages data which again showed double-digit annual growth or new comments from Prime Minister Viktor Orban highlighting tension with Brussels, market participants said. The surge in wages is unlikely to boost inflation in the short term and lead to less loose central bank policy, analysts said. Markets continue to ignore an East-West divide in the European Union over differences in views about immigration and the role of national governments, one Budapest-based fixed income trader said. \"We are yet to see if the jostling turns into a street fight,\" the trader said. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Friday that EU leaders should not make sweeping decisions on migration before next year's European Parliament elections. Hungary's forint eased 0.1 percent against the euro by 0902 GMT, just like the zloty and the leu , while regional stock markets were mixed. The region's currencies are still near the 2-month highs they reached by early this week as investors chose Central European currencies and bonds instead of other emerging markets, which were hit by jitters, like Russia and Turkey. The dinar firmed slightly to 118.05 ahead of an auction of 3-year Serbian government bonds. Auctions this year often buoyed the dinar which has also been strengthened by increased demand for lending, FDI inflows and robust exports. The Serbian central bank repeatedly sold the currency which remains resistant even though the bank last week surprised at its second consecutive rate-setting meeting by reducing its benchmark rate. \"Although market demand at the debt auction is likely to be good, strong RSD may raise more concerns with the regulator (central bank) so a possibility of FX interventions should not be ruled out,\" Raiffeisen analyst Gintaras Shlizhyus said in a note.

It works by first identifying all entities of the specified types within the text, ensuring that each entity's name is an atomic word from the input text and avoiding duplicates and generic terms. The program then provides detailed descriptions for each entity, including its role, key attributes, relationships to other entities, historical or cultural relevance, and notable actions or events associated with it. For relationships, the program identifies both direct and higher-order relationships, providing comprehensive descriptions that include the nature of the relationship, its impact on both entities, historical or contextual information, how the relationship evolved over time, and notable events or actions resulting from the relationship. The program uses a language model to perform these tasks, ensuring that the output adheres to the specified type annotations and instructions.\n"

The text mentions \"Shanghai Stock Exchange,\" \"YONGHUI SUPERSTORES Co LTd,\" \"166.3 MILLION SHARES,\" \"1.63 BILLION YUAN,\" \"Jan 22,\" and \"Hong Kong newsroom.\" These entities correspond to the types \"ORGANIZATION,\" \"ORGANIZATION,\" \"MEASUREMENT,\" \"MONEY,\" \"DATE,\" and \"ORGANIZATION,\" respectively. Next, we identify relationships between these entities. The block trade involves \"YONGHUI SUPERSTORES Co LTd\" and \"166.3 MILLION SHARES,\" which is a direct relationship. The trade amount is \"1.63 BILLION YUAN,\" which is also directly related to the trade. The date \"Jan 22\" is directly related to the trade event. The \"Hong Kong newsroom\" reported on this event, establishing a second-order relationship. The \"Shanghai Stock Exchange\" is the venue for the trade, also establishing a direct relationship. Finally, we ensure all descriptions are detailed and comprehensive, including roles, attributes, and relationships.\n",

      "PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The program is designed to solve the task of extracting entities and their relationships from a given text document based on a predefined list of entity types. It works by first identifying all entities of the specified types within the text, ensuring that each entity's name is an atomic word from the input text and avoiding duplicates and generic terms. The program then provides detailed descriptions for each entity, including its role, key attributes, relationships to other entities, historical or cultural relevance, and notable actions or events associated with it. For relationships, the program identifies both direct and higher-order relationships, providing comprehensive descriptions that include the nature of the relationship, its impact on both entities, historical or contextual information, how the relationship evolved over time, and notable events or actions resulting from the relationship. The program uses a language model to perform these tasks, ensuring that the output adheres to the specified type annotations and instructions.\n",

      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the entities_relationships. We first identify the entities in the text based on the provided entity types. The text mentions \"Shanghai Stock Exchange,\" \"YONGHUI SUPERSTORES Co LTd,\" \"166.3 MILLION SHARES,\" \"1.63 BILLION YUAN,\" \"Jan 22,\" and \"Hong Kong newsroom.\" These entities correspond to the types \"ORGANIZATION,\" \"ORGANIZATION,\" \"MEASUREMENT,\" \"MONEY,\" \"DATE,\" and \"ORGANIZATION,\" respectively. Next, we identify relationships between these entities. The block trade involves \"YONGHUI SUPERSTORES Co LTd\" and \"166.3 MILLION SHARES,\" which is a direct relationship. The trade amount is \"1.63 BILLION YUAN,\" which is also directly related to the trade. The date \"Jan 22\" is directly related to the trade event. The \"Hong Kong newsroom\" reported on this event, establishing a second-order relationship. The \"Shanghai Stock Exchange\" is the venue for the trade, also establishing a direct relationship. Finally, we ensure all descriptions are detailed and comprehensive, including roles, attributes, and relationships.\n",

      "PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The program is designed to solve a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task involving the extraction of entities and relationships from text documents. It works by taking an input text and a list of entity types, then identifying all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities. The program ensures that descriptions of entities and relationships are detailed and comprehensive, including roles, attributes, historical context, and notable actions or events. It also handles direct, second-order, and third-order relationships. The output is formatted as a JSON object containing lists of entities and relationships, adhering to a specified schema.\n",

      "Doubles total addressable market in the U.S. to over three million annual procedures\n",
      "RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- TransEnterix, Inc. (NYSE American:TRXC), a medical device company that is digitizing the interface between the surgeon and the patient to improve minimally invasive surgery, today announced that the Company has received FDA 510(k) clearance for expanded indications of its Senhance Surgical System.\n",
      "The Company received FDA 510(k) clearance for laparoscopic inguinal hernia and laparoscopic cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) surgery. There are approximately 760,000 inguinal hernia and 1.2 million laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures performed annually in the U.S. With this clearance, Senhance System's total addressable annual procedures in the U.S. has more than doubled to over three million.\n",
      "“This indication expansion immediately doubles the addressable market for Senhance in the US and validates our regulatory strategy to successfully add to our indications for use,” said Todd M. Pope, president and chief executive officer of TransEnterix. “These expanded procedures are commonly performed at over 95% of hospitals in the United States. We believe this indication expansion will significantly increase the applicability of Senhance to more institutions, particularly those with a busy general surgery practice.”\n",
      "In the U.S., Senhance is now cleared for laparoscopic colorectal, gynecologic, inguinal hernia and cholecystectomy surgery. This enables Senhance to be used for some of the most common abdominal surgeries, including procedures in general surgery and gynecology.\n",
      "“We have utilized Senhance broadly across a wide range of general surgery, upper GI surgery and colorectal procedures at our institution,” said Professor Dr. Frank Willeke, Chief of Surgery at St. Marien Hospital in Siegen, Germany. “We believe this procedural expansion for the US will allow surgeons there to incorporate the Senhance, as we have, as a highly-efficient, enabling and very promising technology that can impact the vast majority of surgeries commonly performed by general surgeons and their sub-specialties.”\n",

      "Input Text: * Polish, Hungarian bonds track steepening Bund yield curve * Investors ignore Hungarian wage data, CEE tension with Brussels * Serbia's 2021-expiry bond auction seen drawing strong demand By Sandor Peto BUDAPEST, April 20 (Reuters) - Long-term yields in some Central European markets tracked a rise in euro zone peers on Friday, while a 3-year bond auction in Serbia was expected to draw strong demand. Germany's 10-year bond yield rose to an almost 5-week high as a surge in oil prices increased inflation expectations. Polish and Hungarian bonds tracked a steepening Bund yield curve. Poland's 10-year yield rose 2 basis points (bps) from Thursday's close to 3.061, and Hungary's equivalent yield, at 2.49 percent, was 3 bps above Thursday's fixing. Hungary's advance was not linked with either gross wages data which again showed double-digit annual growth or new comments from Prime Minister Viktor Orban highlighting tension with Brussels, market participants said. The surge in wages is unlikely to boost inflation in the short term and lead to less loose central bank policy, analysts said. Markets continue to ignore an East-West divide in the European Union over differences in views about immigration and the role of national governments, one Budapest-based fixed income trader said. \"We are yet to see if the jostling turns into a street fight,\" the trader said. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Friday that EU leaders should not make sweeping decisions on migration before next year's European Parliament elections. Hungary's forint eased 0.1 percent against the euro by 0902 GMT, just like the zloty and the leu , while regional stock markets were mixed. The region's currencies are still near the 2-month highs they reached by early this week as investors chose Central European currencies and bonds instead of other emerging markets, which were hit by jitters, like Russia and Turkey. The dinar firmed slightly to 118.05 ahead of an auction of 3-year Serbian government bonds. Auctions this year often buoyed the dinar which has also been strengthened by increased demand for lending, FDI inflows and robust exports. The Serbian central bank repeatedly sold the currency which remains resistant even though the bank last week surprised at its second consecutive rate-setting meeting by reducing its benchmark rate. \"Although market demand at the debt auction is likely to be good, strong RSD may raise more concerns with the regulator (central bank) so a possibility of FX interventions should not be ruled out,\" Raiffeisen analyst Gintaras Shlizhyus said in a note.

      "PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The program is designed to solve a task of extracting and describing entities and relationships from a given text document based on a predefined list of entity types. It works by first identifying all entities in the text that match the provided entity types, then describing each entity in detail, including its role, attributes, relationships, and significance. Next, it identifies relationships between these entities, detailing the nature, impact, and evolution of these relationships, ensuring that all relationships are direct (order 1), second-order (order 2), and third-order (order 3) where applicable. Finally, it compiles all entities and relationships into a single JSON object, adhering to the specified schema.\n",

      "Input Text: Receives FDA 510(k) clearance for laparoscopic inguinal hernia and laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures\n",
      "Doubles total addressable market in the U.S. to over three million annual procedures\n",
      "RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- TransEnterix, Inc. (NYSE American:TRXC), a medical device company that is digitizing the interface between the surgeon and the patient to improve minimally invasive surgery, today announced that the Company has received FDA 510(k) clearance for expanded indications of its Senhance Surgical System.\n",
      "The Company received FDA 510(k) clearance for laparoscopic inguinal hernia and laparoscopic cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) surgery. There are approximately 760,000 inguinal hernia and 1.2 million laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures performed annually in the U.S. With this clearance, Senhance System's total addressable annual procedures in the U.S. has more than doubled to over three million.\n",
      "“This indication expansion immediately doubles the addressable market for Senhance in the US and validates our regulatory strategy to successfully add to our indications for use,” said Todd M. Pope, president and chief executive officer of TransEnterix. “These expanded procedures are commonly performed at over 95% of hospitals in the United States. We believe this indication expansion will significantly increase the applicability of Senhance to more institutions, particularly those with a busy general surgery practice.”\n",
      "In the U.S., Senhance is now cleared for laparoscopic colorectal, gynecologic, inguinal hernia and cholecystectomy surgery. This enables Senhance to be used for some of the most common abdominal surgeries, including procedures in general surgery and gynecology.\n",
      "“We have utilized Senhance broadly across a wide range of general surgery, upper GI surgery and colorectal procedures at our institution,” said Professor Dr. Frank Willeke, Chief of Surgery at St. Marien Hospital in Siegen, Germany. “We believe this procedural expansion for the US will allow surgeons there to incorporate the Senhance, as we have, as a highly-efficient, enabling and very promising technology that can impact the vast majority of surgeries commonly performed by general surgeons and their sub-specialties.”\n",
      "About TransEnterix\n",

      "Input Text: * Polish, Hungarian bonds track steepening Bund yield curve * Investors ignore Hungarian wage data, CEE tension with Brussels * Serbia's 2021-expiry bond auction seen drawing strong demand By Sandor Peto BUDAPEST, April 20 (Reuters) - Long-term yields in some Central European markets tracked a rise in euro zone peers on Friday, while a 3-year bond auction in Serbia was expected to draw strong demand. Germany's 10-year bond yield rose to an almost 5-week high as a surge in oil prices increased inflation expectations. Polish and Hungarian bonds tracked a steepening Bund yield curve. Poland's 10-year yield rose 2 basis points (bps) from Thursday's close to 3.061, and Hungary's equivalent yield, at 2.49 percent, was 3 bps above Thursday's fixing. Hungary's advance was not linked with either gross wages data which again showed double-digit annual growth or new comments from Prime Minister Viktor Orban highlighting tension with Brussels, market participants said. The surge in wages is unlikely to boost inflation in the short term and lead to less loose central bank policy, analysts said. Markets continue to ignore an East-West divide in the European Union over differences in views about immigration and the role of national governments, one Budapest-based fixed income trader said. \"We are yet to see if the jostling turns into a street fight,\" the trader said. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Friday that EU leaders should not make sweeping decisions on migration before next year's European Parliament elections. Hungary's forint eased 0.1 percent against the euro by 0902 GMT, just like the zloty and the leu , while regional stock markets were mixed. The region's currencies are still near the 2-month highs they reached by early this week as investors chose Central European currencies and bonds instead of other emerging markets, which were hit by jitters, like Russia and Turkey. The dinar firmed slightly to 118.05 ahead of an auction of 3-year Serbian government bonds. Auctions this year often buoyed the dinar which has also been strengthened by increased demand for lending, FDI inflows and robust exports. The Serbian central bank repeatedly sold the currency which remains resistant even though the bank last week surprised at its second consecutive rate-setting meeting by reducing its benchmark rate. \"Although market demand at the debt auction is likely to be good, strong RSD may raise more concerns with the regulator (central bank) so a possibility of FX interventions should not be ruled out,\" Raiffeisen analyst Gintaras Shlizhyus said in a note.

It works by first identifying all entities in the text that match the specified entity types, ensuring that each entity is described in detail, including its role, attributes, and significance. Then, it identifies and describes relationships between these entities, including direct, second-order, and third-order relationships, detailing the nature, impact, and evolution of each relationship. Finally, it compiles all this information into a structured JSON object, adhering to a specified schema.\n",

It works by first defining a signature that specifies the input (text document and entity types) and the expected outputs (reasoning and entities_relationships).

The TypedEntityRelationshipExtractor module orchestrates the extraction process, leveraging the TypedChainOfThought to identify entities and their relationships, ensuring detailed descriptions and comprehensive relationships, including direct and higher-order relationships. The final output is a JSON object containing entities and their relationships, formatted according to the specified schema.\n"

      "PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The program is designed to solve the task of entity and relationship extraction from text documents. It works by first defining a signature that specifies the input (text document and entity types) and the expected outputs (reasoning and entities_relationships). The program then uses a TypedPredictor to enforce type annotations and handle retries if the output is invalid. The TypedEntityRelationshipExtractor module orchestrates the extraction process, leveraging the TypedChainOfThought to identify entities and their relationships, ensuring detailed descriptions and comprehensive relationships, including direct and higher-order relationships. The final output is a JSON object containing entities and their relationships, formatted according to the specified schema.\n",

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu admitted to creating stronger strategic alliances with Arab countries in the wake of an emboldened Iran, calling it \"an extraordinary thing\" that he has not seen in his country's entire history.\n",
      "\"There is an alliance between Israel and other countries in the Middle East that would have been unimaginable years ago. I've never seen anything like it in my lifetime,\" he said Thursday on panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n",
      "Netanyahu ripped into the Iran nuclear deal , stressing that many countries, particularly in the Arab world, agree with him.\n",
      "\"If Iran tries to rush for a bomb, there are many countries that will not let them,\" the prime minister said. \"We would not let them acquire a nuclear weapon. There are Arab states, unnamed, that agree with me.\"\n",
      "The Iran deal or the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), enacted in 2015 by Iran, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council — China, France, Russia, the U.K. and the U.S. — and Germany, allowed the lifting of international sanctions on Iran in exchange for compliance with restrictions on its nuclear program.\n",
      "The UN's International Atomic Energy Agency confirms Iran is complying with the deal's rules, while its European signatories have praised it, saying it brought more stability to the region and averted a potential nuclear war.\n",
      "Israel and Saudi Arabia were some of the deal's most prominent opponents.\n",
      "The result has been a growing strategic alliance — one that has reportedly gone back for several years — between Israel, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, and it's become closer than at any point in the region's history.\n",
      "\"It is an extraordinary thing — it starts with a common concern, a common enemy, which is extremist Islam and terrorism, both Sunni and Shia extremism,\" Netanyahu said.\n",
      "\"Also,\" he said, \"Our common stance against Iran.\"\n",
      "And there was another source of this closeness, the prime minister said. \"It's the desire (of Arab states) to make use of the civilian technology in Israel has — in health, agriculture, water, energy — to better the lives of their citizens.\"\n",
      "\"I view that as a great promise of peace,\" he said. \"We see the beginning of changes in the attitudes toward Israel of (Arab) publics — not all of it, but a significant minority. That is hope, that is the future of peace, and that could mean the Palestinians too.\"\n",
      "The comments come against a backdrop of ever-heating regional tensions between the Sunni Muslim Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Shiite Muslim-dominated Iran, and amid continued anger across the Arab world at U.S. President Donald Trump's decision in December to name Jerusalem as the Israeli capital .\n",

      "January 29, 2018 / 8:29 AM / Updated 30 minutes ago Nokia introduces high-capacity 5G chipsets, to ship in volume in third quarter Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n",
      "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Nokia is introducing new silicon chipsets for running next-generation 5G wireless networks that promise to cut antenna size in half, triple data-handling capacity and cut the power consumption of mobile towers, the company said on Monday. \n",
      "The chipsets, known as ReefShark, are expected to ship in volume during the third quarter of 2018 and can be inserted into Nokia’s existing AirScale family of 4G and 5G-ready network gear, the world’s No.2 maker of mobile network gear said. \n",
      "Nokia said it is working with 30 mobile operators to deploy the new chipsets into their wireless towers, meaning that the first networks could be upgraded later this year, with mass-market deployments to follow as 5G-ready devices hit the market. \n",
      "ReefShark chipsets are designed to work in so-called Massive MIMO antennas that are able to send and receive dozens of separate streams of data, offering many times more network capacity and greater wireless coverage from a single cell tower. \n",
      "The chipsets will allow the size of antennas, on average, to be cut in half to as small as 45 centimetres (18 inches) tall from existing antennas that currently range in size from 1 metre (3.3 ft) to 2.6 metres tall, enabling them to be installed in far more locations.

      "The Iran deal or the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), enacted in 2015 by Iran, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council — China, France, Russia, the U.K. and the U.S. — and Germany, allowed the lifting of international sanctions on Iran in exchange for compliance with restrictions on its nuclear program.\n",
      "The UN's International Atomic Energy Agency confirms Iran is complying with the deal's rules, while its European signatories have praised it, saying it brought more stability to the region and averted a potential nuclear war.\n",
      "Israel and Saudi Arabia were some of the deal's most prominent opponents.\n",
      "The result has been a growing strategic alliance — one that has reportedly gone back for several years — between Israel, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, and it's become closer than at any point in the region's history.\n",
      "\"It is an extraordinary thing — it starts with a common concern, a common enemy, which is extremist Islam and terrorism, both Sunni and Shia extremism,\" Netanyahu said.\n",
      "\"Also,\" he said, \"Our common stance against Iran.\"\n",
      "And there was another source of this closeness, the prime minister said. \"It's the desire (of Arab states) to make use of the civilian technology in Israel has — in health, agriculture, water, energy — to better the lives of their citizens.\"\n",
      "\"I view that as a great promise of peace,\" he said. \"We see the beginning of changes in the attitudes toward Israel of (Arab) publics — not all of it, but a significant minority. That is hope, that is the future of peace, and that could mean the Palestinians too.\"\n",
      "The comments come against a backdrop of ever-heating regional tensions between the Sunni Muslim Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Shiite Muslim-dominated Iran, and amid continued anger across the Arab world at U.S. President Donald Trump's decision in December to name Jerusalem as the Israeli capital .\n",

      "January 29, 2018 / 8:29 AM / Updated 30 minutes ago Nokia introduces high-capacity 5G chipsets, to ship in volume in third quarter Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n",
      "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Nokia is introducing new silicon chipsets for running next-generation 5G wireless networks that promise to cut antenna size in half, triple data-handling capacity and cut the power consumption of mobile towers, the company said on Monday. \n",
      "The chipsets, known as ReefShark, are expected to ship in volume during the third quarter of 2018 and can be inserted into Nokia’s existing AirScale family of 4G and 5G-ready network gear, the world’s No.2 maker of mobile network gear said. \n",
      "Nokia said it is working with 30 mobile operators to deploy the new chipsets into their wireless towers, meaning that the first networks could be upgraded later this year, with mass-market deployments to follow as 5G-ready devices hit the market. \n",
      "ReefShark chipsets are designed to work in so-called Massive MIMO antennas that are able to send and receive dozens of separate streams of data, offering many times more network capacity and greater wireless coverage from a single cell tower. \n",
      "The chipsets will allow the size of antennas, on average, to be cut in half to as small as 45 centimetres (18 inches) tall from existing antennas that currently range in size from 1 metre (3.3 ft) to 2.6 metres tall, enabling them to be installed in far more locations.

      "\u001b[32mReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the entities_relationships. We first identify the entities in the text based on the provided entity types. From the text, we can extract entities such as \"Trump\" (PERSON), \"White House\" (ORGANIZATION), \"Ronny Jackson\" (PERSON), \"Department of Veterans Affairs\" (ORGANIZATION), \"CNBC\" (ORGANIZATION), \"Kayla Tausche\" (PERSON), \"Rear Admiral\" (TITLE), \"2 Hours Ago\" (TIME). We then analyze the relationships between these entities. For example, \"Trump\" has a direct relationship with \"Ronny Jackson\" as he \"tapped\" him for a new role. Similarly, \"Ronny Jackson\" has a direct relationship with \"Department of Veterans Affairs\" as he is to run it. We also identify higher-order relationships, such as the indirect effect of \"Trump\" tapping \"Ronny Jackson\" on the \"White House\" shakeup. Finally, we compile these entities and relationships into a JSON object following the specified schema.\n",

(NYSE American:TRXC), a medical device company that is digitizing the interface between the surgeon and the patient to improve minimally invasive surgery, today announced that the Company has received FDA 510(k) clearance for expanded indications of its Senhance Surgical System.\\nThe Company received FDA 510(k) clearance for laparoscopic inguinal hernia and laparoscopic cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) surgery. There are approximately 760,000 inguinal hernia and 1.2 million laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures performed annually in the U.S. With this clearance, Senhance System\\'s total addressable annual procedures in the U.S. has more than doubled to over three million.\\n“This indication expansion immediately doubles the addressable market for Senhance in the US and validates our regulatory strategy to successfully add to our indications for use,” said Todd M. Pope, president and chief executive officer of TransEnterix. “These expanded procedures are commonly performed at over 95% of hospitals in the United States. We believe this indication expansion will significantly increase the applicability of Senhance to more institutions, particularly those with a busy general surgery practice.”\\nIn the U.S., Senhance is now cleared for laparoscopic colorectal, gynecologic, inguinal hernia and cholecystectomy surgery. This enables Senhance to be used for some of the most common abdominal surgeries, including procedures in general surgery and gynecology.\\n“We have utilized Senhance broadly across a wide range of general surgery, upper GI surgery and colorectal procedures at our institution,” said Professor Dr. Frank Willeke, Chief of Surgery at St. Marien Hospital in Siegen, Germany. “We believe this procedural expansion for the US will allow surgeons there to incorporate the Senhance, as we have, as a highly-efficient, enabling and very promising technology that can impact the vast majority of surgeries commonly performed by general surgeons and their sub-specialties.”\\nAbout TransEnterix\\nTransEnterix is a medical device company that is digitizing the interface between the surgeon and the patient to improve minimally invasive surgery by addressing the clinical and economic challenges associated with current laparoscopic and robotic options in today\\'s value-based healthcare environment. The Company is focused on the commercialization of the Senhance Surgical System, which digitizes laparoscopic minimally invasive surgery. The system allows for robotic precision, haptic feedback, surgeon camera control via eye sensing and improved ergonomics while offering responsible economics. The Senhance Surgical System is available for sale in the US, the EU and select other countries.

economist at Scotiabank, said the figures showed Britain’s economy was growing at roughly the pace the BoE sees its new, lower speed limit, meaning a rate hike was still on the cards.\\nBut Samuel Tombs, at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the data showed the central bank should delay any action for now.\\n“The latest GDP data suggest that the economy remains in a fragile state and does not need to be cooled with another rate rise as soon as May,” he said in a note to clients.\\nBoE Governor Mark Carney said this month that rates would probably need to rise sooner and by somewhat more than the central bank had thought in November, when it raised borrowing costs for the first time in a decade.\\nMost economists think rates will rise again in May, and financial markets expect a further increase, to 1 percent, by the end of the year.\\nLAGGARD UK Britain’s year-on-year economic growth of 1.4 percent in the last three months of 2017 was not just its weakest in five years but also the weakest of any of the economies in the Group of Seven, including long-term laggards such as Japan and Italy.\\nThere were only limited signs of a rebalancing of the economy away from consumer demand and toward business investment and net trade that Carney pointed to as positive signs in an appearance before lawmakers on Wednesday.\\nBusiness investment was flat on the quarter and 2.1 percent higher on the year, both readings coming in weaker than expected in a Reuters poll of economists. Net trade dragged on growth in most quarters of 2017, though it was positive on the year.\\nThe BoE said earlier this month that it expected the economy would grow by 1.8 percent this year, faster than its previous forecast of 1.6 percent, mostly because of the strength of the global economy.\\nReporting by David Milliken; Editing by Toby Chopra\\n ', 'entity_types': ['PERSON', 'ORGANIZATION', 'LOCATION', 'DATE', 'TIME', 'MONEY', 'PERCENTAGE', 'PRODUCT', 'EVENT', 'LANGUAGE', 'NATIONALITY', 'RELIGION', 'TITLE', 'PROFESSION', 'ANIMAL', 'PLANT', 'DISEASE', 'MEDICATION', 'CHEMICAL', 'MATERIAL', 'COLOR', 'SHAPE', 'MEASUREMENT', 'WEATHER', 'NATURAL_DISASTER', 'AWARD', 'LAW', 'CRIME', 'TECHNOLOGY', 'SOFTWARE', 'HARDWARE', 'VEHICLE', 'FOOD', 'DRINK', 'SPORT', 'MUSIC_GENRE', 'INSTRUMENT', 'ARTWORK', 'BOOK', 'MOVIE', 'TV_SHOW', 'ACADEMIC_SUBJECT', 'SCIENTIFIC_THEORY', 'POLITICAL_PARTY', 'CURRENCY', 'STOCK_SYMBOL', 'FILE_TYPE', 'PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE', 'MEDICAL_PROCEDURE', 'CELESTIAL_BODY'], 'reasoning': 'produce the entities_relationships.

2021-expiry bond auction seen drawing strong demand By Sandor Peto BUDAPEST, April 20 (Reuters) - Long-term yields in some Central European markets tracked a rise in euro zone peers on Friday, while a 3-year bond auction in Serbia was expected to draw strong demand. Germany\\'s 10-year bond yield rose to an almost 5-week high as a surge in oil prices increased inflation expectations. Polish and Hungarian bonds tracked a steepening Bund yield curve. Poland\\'s 10-year yield rose 2 basis points (bps) from Thursday\\'s close to 3.061, and Hungary\\'s equivalent yield, at 2.49 percent, was 3 bps above Thursday\\'s fixing. Hungary\\'s advance was not linked with either gross wages data which again showed double-digit annual growth or new comments from Prime Minister Viktor Orban highlighting tension with Brussels, market participants said. The surge in wages is unlikely to boost inflation in the short term and lead to less loose central bank policy, analysts said. Markets continue to ignore an East-West divide in the European Union over differences in views about immigration and the role of national governments, one Budapest-based fixed income trader said. \"We are yet to see if the jostling turns into a street fight,\" the trader said. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Friday that EU leaders should not make sweeping decisions on migration before next year\\'s European Parliament elections. Hungary\\'s forint eased 0.1 percent against the euro by 0902 GMT, just like the zloty and the leu , while regional stock markets were mixed. The region\\'s currencies are still near the 2-month highs they reached by early this week as investors chose Central European currencies and bonds instead of other emerging markets, which were hit by jitters, like Russia and Turkey. The dinar firmed slightly to 118.05 ahead of an auction of 3-year Serbian government bonds. Auctions this year often buoyed the dinar which has also been strengthened by increased demand for lending, FDI inflows and robust exports. The Serbian central bank repeatedly sold the currency which remains resistant even though the bank last week surprised at its second consecutive rate-setting meeting by reducing its benchmark rate. \"Although market demand at the debt auction is likely to be good, strong RSD may raise more concerns with the regulator (central bank) so a possibility of FX interventions should not be ruled out,\" Raiffeisen analyst Gintaras Shlizhyus said in a note.

(NYSE American:TRXC), a medical device company that is digitizing the interface between the surgeon and the patient to improve minimally invasive surgery, today announced that the Company has received FDA 510(k) clearance for expanded indications of its Senhance Surgical System.\\nThe Company received FDA 510(k) clearance for laparoscopic inguinal hernia and laparoscopic cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) surgery. There are approximately 760,000 inguinal hernia and 1.2 million laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures performed annually in the U.S. With this clearance, Senhance System\\'s total addressable annual procedures in the U.S. has more than doubled to over three million.\\n“This indication expansion immediately doubles the addressable market for Senhance in the US and validates our regulatory strategy to successfully add to our indications for use,” said Todd M. Pope, president and chief executive officer of TransEnterix. “These expanded procedures are commonly performed at over 95% of hospitals in the United States. We believe this indication expansion will significantly increase the applicability of Senhance to more institutions, particularly those with a busy general surgery practice.”\\nIn the U.S., Senhance is now cleared for laparoscopic colorectal, gynecologic, inguinal hernia and cholecystectomy surgery. This enables Senhance to be used for some of the most common abdominal surgeries, including procedures in general surgery and gynecology.\\n“We have utilized Senhance broadly across a wide range of general surgery, upper GI surgery and colorectal procedures at our institution,” said Professor Dr. Frank Willeke, Chief of Surgery at St. Marien Hospital in Siegen, Germany. “We believe this procedural expansion for the US will allow surgeons there to incorporate the Senhance, as we have, as a highly-efficient, enabling and very promising technology that can impact the vast majority of surgeries commonly performed by general surgeons and their sub-specialties.”\\nAbout TransEnterix\\nTransEnterix is a medical device company that is digitizing the interface between the surgeon and the patient to improve minimally invasive surgery by addressing the clinical and economic challenges associated with current laparoscopic and robotic options in today\\'s value-based healthcare environment. The Company is focused on the commercialization of the Senhance Surgical System, which digitizes laparoscopic minimally invasive surgery. The system allows for robotic precision, haptic feedback, surgeon camera control via eye sensing and improved ergonomics while offering responsible economics. The Senhance Surgical System is available for sale in the US, the EU and select other countries.

to ship in volume in third quarter Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \\nFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Nokia is introducing new silicon chipsets for running next-generation 5G wireless networks that promise to cut antenna size in half, triple data-handling capacity and cut the power consumption of mobile towers, the company said on Monday. \\nThe chipsets, known as ReefShark, are expected to ship in volume during the third quarter of 2018 and can be inserted into Nokia’s existing AirScale family of 4G and 5G-ready network gear, the world’s No.2 maker of mobile network gear said. \\nNokia said it is working with 30 mobile operators to deploy the new chipsets into their wireless towers, meaning that the first networks could be upgraded later this year, with mass-market deployments to follow as 5G-ready devices hit the market. \\nReefShark chipsets are designed to work in so-called Massive MIMO antennas that are able to send and receive dozens of separate streams of data, offering many times

(NYSE American:TRXC), a medical device company that is digitizing the interface between the surgeon and the patient to improve minimally invasive surgery, today announced that the Company has received FDA 510(k) clearance for expanded indications of its Senhance Surgical System.\\nThe Company received FDA 510(k) clearance for laparoscopic inguinal hernia and laparoscopic cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) surgery. There are approximately 760,000 inguinal hernia and 1.2 million laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures performed annually in the U.S. With this clearance, Senhance System\\'s total addressable annual procedures in the U.S. has more than doubled to over three million.\\n“This indication expansion immediately doubles the addressable market for Senhance in the US and validates our regulatory strategy to successfully add to our indications for use,” said Todd M. Pope, president and chief executive officer of TransEnterix. “These expanded procedures are commonly performed at over 95% of hospitals in the United States. We believe this indication expansion will significantly increase the applicability of Senhance to more institutions, particularly those with a busy general surgery practice.”\\nIn the U.S., Senhance is now cleared for laparoscopic colorectal, gynecologic, inguinal hernia and cholecystectomy surgery. This enables Senhance to be used for some of the most common abdominal surgeries, including procedures in general surgery and gynecology.\\n“We have utilized Senhance broadly across a wide range of general surgery, upper GI surgery and colorectal procedures at our institution,” said Professor Dr. Frank Willeke, Chief of Surgery at St. Marien Hospital in Siegen, Germany. “We believe this procedural expansion for the US will allow surgeons there to incorporate the Senhance, as we have, as a highly-efficient, enabling and very promising technology that can impact the vast majority of surgeries commonly performed by general surgeons and their sub-specialties.”\\nAbout TransEnterix\\nTransEnterix is a medical device company that is digitizing the interface between the surgeon and the patient to improve minimally invasive surgery by addressing the clinical and economic challenges associated with current laparoscopic and robotic options in today\\'s value-based healthcare environment. The Company is focused on the commercialization of the Senhance Surgical System, which digitizes laparoscopic minimally invasive surgery. The system allows for robotic precision, haptic feedback, surgeon camera control via eye sensing and improved ergonomics while offering responsible economics. The Senhance Surgical System is available for sale in the US, the EU and select other countries.

Germany\\'s 10-year bond yield rose to an almost 5-week high as a surge in oil prices increased inflation expectations. Polish and Hungarian bonds tracked a steepening Bund yield curve. Poland\\'s 10-year yield rose 2 basis points (bps) from Thursday\\'s close to 3.061, and Hungary\\'s equivalent yield, at 2.49 percent, was 3 bps above Thursday\\'s fixing. Hungary\\'s advance was not linked with either gross wages data which again showed double-digit annual growth or new comments from Prime Minister Viktor Orban highlighting tension with Brussels, market participants said. The surge in wages is unlikely to boost inflation in the short term and lead to less loose central bank policy, analysts said. Markets continue to ignore an East-West divide in the European Union over differences in views about immigration and the role of national governments, one Budapest-based fixed income trader said. \"We are yet to see if the jostling turns into a street fight,\" the trader said. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Friday that EU leaders should not make sweeping decisions on migration before next year\\'s European Parliament elections. Hungary\\'s forint eased 0.1 percent against the euro by 0902 GMT, just like the zloty and the leu , while regional stock markets were mixed. The region\\'s currencies are still near the 2-month highs they reached by early this week as investors chose Central European currencies and bonds instead of other emerging markets, which were hit by jitters, like Russia and Turkey. The dinar firmed slightly to 118.05 ahead of an auction of 3-year Serbian government bonds. Auctions this year often buoyed the dinar which has also been strengthened by increased demand for lending, FDI inflows and robust exports. The Serbian central bank repeatedly sold the currency which remains resistant even though the bank last week surprised at its second consecutive rate-setting meeting by reducing its benchmark rate. \"Although market demand at the debt auction is likely to be good, strong RSD may raise more concerns with the regulator (central bank) so a possibility of FX interventions should not be ruled out,\" Raiffeisen analyst Gintaras Shlizhyus said in a note.

Min Read \\nFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Nokia is introducing new silicon chipsets for running next-generation 5G wireless networks that promise to cut antenna size in half, triple data-handling capacity and cut the power consumption of mobile towers, the company said on Monday. \\nThe chipsets, known as ReefShark, are expected to ship in volume during the third quarter of 2018 and can be inserted into Nokia’s existing AirScale family of 4G and 5G-ready network gear, the world’s No.2 maker of mobile network gear said. \\nNokia said it is working with 30 mobile operators to deploy the new chipsets into their wireless towers, meaning that the first networks could be upgraded later this year, with mass-market deployments to follow as 5G-ready devices hit the market. \\nReefShark chipsets are designed to work in so-called Massive MIMO antennas that are able to send and receive dozens of separate streams of data, offering many times more network capacity and greater wireless coverage from a single cell tower. \\nThe chipsets will allow the size of antennas, on average, to be cut in half to as small as 45 centimetres (18 inches) tall from existing antennas that currently range in size from 1 metre (3.3 ft) to 2.6 metres tall, enabling them to be installed in far more locations.

steepening Bund yield curve * Investors ignore Hungarian wage data, CEE tension with Brussels * Serbia\\'s 2021-expiry bond auction seen drawing strong demand By Sandor Peto BUDAPEST, April 20 (Reuters) - Long-term yields in some Central European markets tracked a rise in euro zone peers on Friday, while a 3-year bond auction in Serbia was expected to draw strong demand. Germany\\'s 10-year bond yield rose to an almost 5-week high as a surge in oil prices increased inflation expectations. Polish and Hungarian bonds tracked a steepening Bund yield curve. Poland\\'s 10-year yield rose 2 basis points (bps) from Thursday\\'s close to 3.061, and Hungary\\'s equivalent yield, at 2.49 percent, was 3 bps above Thursday\\'s fixing. Hungary\\'s advance was not linked with either gross wages data which again showed double-digit annual growth or new comments from Prime Minister Viktor Orban highlighting tension with Brussels, market participants said. The surge in wages is unlikely to boost inflation in the short term and lead to less loose central bank policy, analysts said. Markets continue to ignore an East-West divide in the European Union over differences in views about immigration and the role of national governments, one Budapest-based fixed income trader said. \"We are yet to see if the jostling turns into a street fight,\" the trader said. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Friday that EU leaders should not make sweeping decisions on migration before next year\\'s European Parliament elections. Hungary\\'s forint eased 0.1 percent against the euro by 0902 GMT, just like the zloty and the leu , while regional stock markets were mixed. The region\\'s currencies are still near the 2-month highs they reached by early this week as investors chose Central European currencies and bonds instead of other emerging markets, which were hit by jitters, like Russia and Turkey. The dinar firmed slightly to 118.05 ahead of an auction of 3-year Serbian government bonds. Auctions this year often buoyed the dinar which has also been strengthened by increased demand for lending, FDI inflows and robust exports. The Serbian central bank repeatedly sold the currency which remains resistant even though the bank last week surprised at its second consecutive rate-setting meeting by reducing its benchmark rate. \"Although market demand at the debt auction is likely to be good, strong RSD may raise more concerns with the regulator (central bank) so a possibility of FX interventions should not be ruled out,\" Raiffeisen analyst Gintaras Shlizhyus said in a note.

Germany\\'s 10-year bond yield rose to an almost 5-week high as a surge in oil prices increased inflation expectations. Polish and Hungarian bonds tracked a steepening Bund yield curve. Poland\\'s 10-year yield rose 2 basis points (bps) from Thursday\\'s close to 3.061, and Hungary\\'s equivalent yield, at 2.49 percent, was 3 bps above Thursday\\'s fixing. Hungary\\'s advance was not linked with either gross wages data which again showed double-digit annual growth or new comments from Prime Minister Viktor Orban highlighting tension with Brussels, market participants said. The surge in wages is unlikely to boost inflation in the short term and lead to less loose central bank policy, analysts said. Markets continue to ignore an East-West divide in the European Union over differences in views about immigration and the role of national governments, one Budapest-based fixed income trader said. \"We are yet to see if the jostling turns into a street fight,\" the trader said. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Friday that EU leaders should not make sweeping decisions on migration before next year\\'s European Parliament elections. Hungary\\'s forint eased 0.1 percent against the euro by 0902 GMT, just like the zloty and the leu , while regional stock markets were mixed. The region\\'s currencies are still near the 2-month highs they reached by early this week as investors chose Central European currencies and bonds instead of other emerging markets, which were hit by jitters, like Russia and Turkey. The dinar firmed slightly to 118.05 ahead of an auction of 3-year Serbian government bonds. Auctions this year often buoyed the dinar which has also been strengthened by increased demand for lending, FDI inflows and robust exports. The Serbian central bank repeatedly sold the currency which remains resistant even though the bank last week surprised at its second consecutive rate-setting meeting by reducing its benchmark rate. \"Although market demand at the debt auction is likely to be good, strong RSD may raise more concerns with the regulator (central bank) so a possibility of FX interventions should not be ruled out,\" Raiffeisen analyst Gintaras Shlizhyus said in a note.

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu admitted to creating stronger strategic alliances with Arab countries in the wake of an emboldened Iran, calling it \"an extraordinary thing\" that he has not seen in his country's entire history.\n",
      "\"There is an alliance between Israel and other countries in the Middle East that would have been unimaginable years ago. I've never seen anything like it in my lifetime,\" he said Thursday on panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n",
      "Netanyahu ripped into the Iran nuclear deal , stressing that many countries, particularly in the Arab world, agree with him.\n",
      "\"If Iran tries to rush for a bomb, there are many countries that will not let them,\" the prime minister said. \"We would not let them acquire a nuclear weapon. There are Arab states, unnamed, that agree with me.\"\n",
      "The Iran deal or the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), enacted in 2015 by Iran, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council — China, France, Russia, the U.K. and the U.S. — and Germany, allowed the lifting of international sanctions on Iran in exchange for compliance with restrictions on its nuclear program.\n",
      "The UN's International Atomic Energy Agency confirms Iran is complying with the deal's rules, while its European signatories have praised it, saying it brought more stability to the region and averted a potential nuclear war.\n",
      "Israel and Saudi Arabia were some of the deal's most prominent opponents.\n",
      "The result has been a growing strategic alliance — one that has reportedly gone back for several years — between Israel, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, and it's become closer than at any point in the region's history.\n",
      "\"It is an extraordinary thing — it starts with a common concern, a common enemy, which is extremist Islam and terrorism, both Sunni and Shia extremism,\" Netanyahu said.\n",
      "\"Also,\" he said, \"Our common stance against Iran.\"\n",
      "And there was another source of this closeness, the prime minister said. \"It's the desire (of Arab states) to make use of the civilian technology in Israel has — in health, agriculture, water, energy — to better the lives of their citizens.\"\n",
      "\"I view that as a great promise of peace,\" he said. \"We see the beginning of changes in the attitudes toward Israel of (Arab) publics — not all of it, but a significant minority. That is hope, that is the future of peace, and that could mean the Palestinians too.\"\n",
      "The comments come against a backdrop of ever-heating regional tensions between the Sunni Muslim Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Shiite Muslim-dominated Iran, and amid continued anger across the Arab world at U.S. President Donald Trump's decision in December to name Jerusalem as the Israeli capital .\n",

      "January 29, 2018 / 8:29 AM / Updated 30 minutes ago Nokia introduces high-capacity 5G chipsets, to ship in volume in third quarter Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n",
      "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Nokia is introducing new silicon chipsets for running next-generation 5G wireless networks that promise to cut antenna size in half, triple data-handling capacity and cut the power consumption of mobile towers, the company said on Monday. \n",
      "The chipsets, known as ReefShark, are expected to ship in volume during the third quarter of 2018 and can be inserted into Nokia’s existing AirScale family of 4G and 5G-ready network gear, the world’s No.2 maker of mobile network gear said. \n",
      "Nokia said it is working with 30 mobile operators to deploy the new chipsets into their wireless towers, meaning that the first networks could be upgraded later this year, with mass-market deployments to follow as 5G-ready devices hit the market. \n",
      "ReefShark chipsets are designed to work in so-called Massive MIMO antennas that are able to send and receive dozens of separate streams of data, offering many times more network capacity and greater wireless coverage from a single cell tower. \n",
      "The chipsets will allow the size of antennas, on average, to be cut in half to as small as 45 centimetres (18 inches) tall from existing antennas that currently range in size from 1 metre (3.3 ft) to 2.6 metres tall, enabling them to be installed in far more locations.

      "\u001b[32mReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the entities_relationships. We first identify the entities in the text based on the provided entity types. From the text, we can extract entities such as \"Trump\" (PERSON), \"White House\" (ORGANIZATION), \"Ronny Jackson\" (PERSON), \"Department of Veterans Affairs\" (ORGANIZATION), \"CNBC\" (ORGANIZATION), \"Kayla Tausche\" (PERSON), \"Rear Admiral\" (TITLE), \"2 Hours Ago\" (TIME). We then analyze the relationships between these entities. For example, \"Trump\" has a direct relationship with \"Ronny Jackson\" as he \"tapped\" him for a new role. Similarly, \"Ronny Jackson\" has a direct relationship with \"Department of Veterans Affairs\" as he is to run it. We also identify higher-order relationships, such as the indirect effect of \"Trump\" tapping \"Ronny Jackson\" on the \"White House\" shakeup. Finally, we compile these entities and relationships into a JSON object following the specified schema.\n",

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu admitted to creating stronger strategic alliances with Arab countries in the wake of an emboldened Iran, calling it \"an extraordinary thing\" that he has not seen in his country's entire history.\n",
      "\"There is an alliance between Israel and other countries in the Middle East that would have been unimaginable years ago. I've never seen anything like it in my lifetime,\" he said Thursday on panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n",
      "Netanyahu ripped into the Iran nuclear deal , stressing that many countries, particularly in the Arab world, agree with him.\n",
      "\"If Iran tries to rush for a bomb, there are many countries that will not let them,\" the prime minister said. \"We would not let them acquire a nuclear weapon. There are Arab states, unnamed, that agree with me.\"\n",
      "The Iran deal or the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), enacted in 2015 by Iran, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council — China, France, Russia, the U.K. and the U.S. — and Germany, allowed the lifting of international sanctions on Iran in exchange for compliance with restrictions on its nuclear program.\n",
      "The UN's International Atomic Energy Agency confirms Iran is complying with the deal's rules, while its European signatories have praised it, saying it brought more stability to the region and averted a potential nuclear war.\n",
      "Israel and Saudi Arabia were some of the deal's most prominent opponents.\n",
      "The result has been a growing strategic alliance — one that has reportedly gone back for several years — between Israel, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, and it's become closer than at any point in the region's history.\n",
      "\"It is an extraordinary thing — it starts with a common concern, a common enemy, which is extremist Islam and terrorism, both Sunni and Shia extremism,\" Netanyahu said.\n",
      "\"Also,\" he said, \"Our common stance against Iran.\"\n",
      "And there was another source of this closeness, the prime minister said. \"It's the desire (of Arab states) to make use of the civilian technology in Israel has — in health, agriculture, water, energy — to better the lives of their citizens.\"\n",
      "\"I view that as a great promise of peace,\" he said. \"We see the beginning of changes in the attitudes toward Israel of (Arab) publics — not all of it, but a significant minority. That is hope, that is the future of peace, and that could mean the Palestinians too.\"\n",
      "The comments come against a backdrop of ever-heating regional tensions between the Sunni Muslim Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Shiite Muslim-dominated Iran, and amid continued anger across the Arab world at U.S. President Donald Trump's decision in December to name Jerusalem as the Israeli capital .\n",

      "January 29, 2018 / 8:29 AM / Updated 30 minutes ago Nokia introduces high-capacity 5G chipsets, to ship in volume in third quarter Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n",
      "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Nokia is introducing new silicon chipsets for running next-generation 5G wireless networks that promise to cut antenna size in half, triple data-handling capacity and cut the power consumption of mobile towers, the company said on Monday. \n",
      "The chipsets, known as ReefShark, are expected to ship in volume during the third quarter of 2018 and can be inserted into Nokia’s existing AirScale family of 4G and 5G-ready network gear, the world’s No.2 maker of mobile network gear said. \n",
      "Nokia said it is working with 30 mobile operators to deploy the new chipsets into their wireless towers, meaning that the first networks could be upgraded later this year, with mass-market deployments to follow as 5G-ready devices hit the market. \n",
      "ReefShark chipsets are designed to work in so-called Massive MIMO antennas that are able to send and receive dozens of separate streams of data, offering many times more network capacity and greater wireless coverage from a single cell tower. \n",
      "The chipsets will allow the size of antennas, on average, to be cut in half to as small as 45 centimetres (18 inches) tall from existing antennas that currently range in size from 1 metre (3.3 ft) to 2.6 metres tall, enabling them to be installed in far more locations.

From the text, we can extract entities such as \"Trump\" (PERSON), \"White House\" (ORGANIZATION), \"Ronny Jackson\" (PERSON), \"Department of Veterans Affairs\" (ORGANIZATION), \"CNBC\" (ORGANIZATION), \"Kayla Tausche\" (PERSON), \"Rear Admiral\" (TITLE), \"2 Hours Ago\" (TIME). We then analyze the relationships between these entities. For example, \"Trump\" has a direct relationship with \"Ronny Jackson\" as he \"tapped\" him for a new role. Similarly, \"Ronny Jackson\" has a direct relationship with \"Department of Veterans Affairs\" as he is to run it. We also identify higher-order relationships, such as the indirect effect of \"Trump\" tapping \"Ronny Jackson\" on the \"White House\" shakeup.

      "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s economy was weaker than previously thought in 2017, official data showed on Thursday, leaving the country lagging further behind the global recovery as it prepares to leave the European Union.\n",
      "The downgrade of the full-year and fourth-quarter growth rates also raised questions about the strength of the economy as the Bank of England prepares to raise interest rates.\n",
      "Gross domestic product growth slowed to a quarterly 0.4 percent from a previous estimate of 0.5 percent, wrong-footing economists and reducing 2017 growth as a whole to 1.7 percent, its lowest since 2012.\n",
      "Related Coverage UK retail sales growth eases further in February: CBI This was still stronger than most economists feared immediately after Britain voted to leave the EU in June 2016.\n",
      "But the country has relied heavily on the unexpectedly robust global economy to sustain its economic growth while consumers have been squeezed by higher inflation caused by the fall in the pound after the Brexit vote.\n",
      "Sterling was little changed after Thursday’s data and government bond prices rose slightly.\n",
      "Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank, said the figures showed Britain’s economy was growing at roughly the pace the BoE sees its new, lower speed limit, meaning a rate hike was still on the cards.\n",
      "But Samuel Tombs, at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the data showed the central bank should delay any action for now.\n",
      "“The latest GDP data suggest that the economy remains in a fragile state and does not need to be cooled with another rate rise as soon as May,” he said in a note to clients.\n",
      "BoE Governor Mark Carney said this month that rates would probably need to rise sooner and by somewhat more than the central bank had thought in November, when it raised borrowing costs for the first time in a decade.\n",
      "Most economists think rates will rise again in May, and financial markets expect a further increase, to 1 percent, by the end of the year.\n",
      "LAGGARD UK Britain’s year-on-year economic growth of 1.4 percent in the last three months of 2017 was not just its weakest in five years but also the weakest of any of the economies in the Group of Seven, including long-term laggards such as Japan and Italy.\n",
      "There were only limited signs of a rebalancing of the economy away from consumer demand and toward business investment and net trade that Carney pointed to as positive signs in an appearance before lawmakers on Wednesday.\n",
      "Business investment was flat on the quarter and 2.1 percent higher on the year, both readings coming in weaker than expected in a Reuters poll of economists. Net trade dragged on growth in most quarters of 2017, though it was positive on the year.\n",
      "The BoE said earlier this month that it expected the economy would grow by 1.8 percent this year, faster than its previous forecast of 1.6 percent, mostly because of the strength of the global economy.\n",

      "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s economy was weaker than previously thought in 2017, official data showed on Thursday, leaving the country lagging further behind the global recovery as it prepares to leave the European Union.\n",
      "The downgrade of the full-year and fourth-quarter growth rates also raised questions about the strength of the economy as the Bank of England prepares to raise interest rates.\n",
      "Gross domestic product growth slowed to a quarterly 0.4 percent from a previous estimate of 0.5 percent, wrong-footing economists and reducing 2017 growth as a whole to 1.7 percent, its lowest since 2012.\n",
      "Related Coverage UK retail sales growth eases further in February: CBI This was still stronger than most economists feared immediately after Britain voted to leave the EU in June 2016.\n",
      "But the country has relied heavily on the unexpectedly robust global economy to sustain its economic growth while consumers have been squeezed by higher inflation caused by the fall in the pound after the Brexit vote.\n",
      "Sterling was little changed after Thursday’s data and government bond prices rose slightly.\n",
      "Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank, said the figures showed Britain’s economy was growing at roughly the pace the BoE sees its new, lower speed limit, meaning a rate hike was still on the cards.\n",
      "But Samuel Tombs, at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the data showed the central bank should delay any action for now.\n",
      "“The latest GDP data suggest that the economy remains in a fragile state and does not need to be cooled with another rate rise as soon as May,” he said in a note to clients.\n",
      "BoE Governor Mark Carney said this month that rates would probably need to rise sooner and by somewhat more than the central bank had thought in November, when it raised borrowing costs for the first time in a decade.\n",
      "Most economists think rates will rise again in May, and financial markets expect a further increase, to 1 percent, by the end of the year.\n",
      "LAGGARD UK Britain’s year-on-year economic growth of 1.4 percent in the last three months of 2017 was not just its weakest in five years but also the weakest of any of the economies in the Group of Seven, including long-term laggards such as Japan and Italy.\n",
      "There were only limited signs of a rebalancing of the economy away from consumer demand and toward business investment and net trade that Carney pointed to as positive signs in an appearance before lawmakers on Wednesday.\n",
      "Business investment was flat on the quarter and 2.1 percent higher on the year, both readings coming in weaker than expected in a Reuters poll of economists. Net trade dragged on growth in most quarters of 2017, though it was positive on the year.\n",
      "The BoE said earlier this month that it expected the economy would grow by 1.8 percent this year, faster than its previous forecast of 1.6 percent, mostly because of the strength of the global economy.\n",

      "“Nikolas Cruz was able to purchase an assault rifle before he was able to buy a beer,” said Stoneman Douglas student Laurenzo Prado, referring to a Florida law that allows people as young as 18 to buy assault weapons. Students galvanized by the deadly mass shooting at the Florida high school confronted lawmakers with demands to restrict sales of assault rifles, while President Donald Trump suggested arming teachers as a way to stop more U.S. rampages.\n",
      "Two weeks before a gunman fatally shot 17 people at a Florida high school, Bill Lee, the president of the state’s school administrators association, warned that Florida’s schools were vulnerable to just such an attack. “It’s not a matter of if, but when,” he wrote in the Orlando Sentinel on Jan. 29, calling on legislators to increase school security spending after two January school shootings in other states.\n",

      "North Korea’s participation in the 2018 Winter Olympics has created an opening for renewed dialogue with the United States and South Korea, writes Peter App s. “By taking part so visibly alongside South Korea, Pyongyang has been able to present itself as a credible global and regional power in a way that has eluded North Korean leaders since the war that divided the peninsula.

      "Input Text: * Polish, Hungarian bonds track steepening Bund yield curve * Investors ignore Hungarian wage data, CEE tension with Brussels * Serbia's 2021-expiry bond auction seen drawing strong demand By Sandor Peto BUDAPEST, April 20 (Reuters) - Long-term yields in some Central European markets tracked a rise in euro zone peers on Friday, while a 3-year bond auction in Serbia was expected to draw strong demand. Germany's 10-year bond yield rose to an almost 5-week high as a surge in oil prices increased inflation expectations. Polish and Hungarian bonds tracked a steepening Bund yield curve. Poland's 10-year yield rose 2 basis points (bps) from Thursday's close to 3.061, and Hungary's equivalent yield, at 2.49 percent, was 3 bps above Thursday's fixing. Hungary's advance was not linked with either gross wages data which again showed double-digit annual growth or new comments from Prime Minister Viktor Orban highlighting tension with Brussels, market participants said. The surge in wages is unlikely to boost inflation in the short term and lead to less loose central bank policy, analysts said. Markets continue to ignore an East-West divide in the European Union over differences in views about immigration and the role of national governments, one Budapest-based fixed income trader said. \"We are yet to see if the jostling turns into a street fight,\" the trader said. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Friday that EU leaders should not make sweeping decisions on migration before next year's European Parliament elections. Hungary's forint eased 0.1 percent against the euro by 0902 GMT, just like the zloty and the leu , while regional stock markets were mixed. The region's currencies are still near the 2-month highs they reached by early this week as investors chose Central European currencies and bonds instead of other emerging markets, which were hit by jitters, like Russia and Turkey. The dinar firmed slightly to 118.05 ahead of an auction of 3-year Serbian government bonds. Auctions this year often buoyed the dinar which has also been strengthened by increased demand for lending, FDI inflows and robust exports. The Serbian central bank repeatedly sold the currency which remains resistant even though the bank last week surprised at its second consecutive rate-setting meeting by reducing its benchmark rate. \"Although market demand at the debt auction is likely to be good, strong RSD may raise more concerns with the regulator (central bank) so a possibility of FX interventions should not be ruled out,\" Raiffeisen analyst Gintaras Shlizhyus said in a note.

The real strategic winner, however, is the South Korean government, which has shrewdly used the games to reshape the diplomatic landscape.”\n",

      "Input Text: * Polish, Hungarian bonds track steepening Bund yield curve * Investors ignore Hungarian wage data, CEE tension with Brussels * Serbia's 2021-expiry bond auction seen drawing strong demand By Sandor Peto BUDAPEST, April 20 (Reuters) - Long-term yields in some Central European markets tracked a rise in euro zone peers on Friday, while a 3-year bond auction in Serbia was expected to draw strong demand. Germany's 10-year bond yield rose to an almost 5-week high as a surge in oil prices increased inflation expectations. Polish and Hungarian bonds tracked a steepening Bund yield curve. Poland's 10-year yield rose 2 basis points (bps) from Thursday's close to 3.061, and Hungary's equivalent yield, at 2.49 percent, was 3 bps above Thursday's fixing. Hungary's advance was not linked with either gross wages data which again showed double-digit annual growth or new comments from Prime Minister Viktor Orban highlighting tension with Brussels, market participants said. The surge in wages is unlikely to boost inflation in the short term and lead to less loose central bank policy, analysts said. Markets continue to ignore an East-West divide in the European Union over differences in views about immigration and the role of national governments, one Budapest-based fixed income trader said. \"We are yet to see if the jostling turns into a street fight,\" the trader said. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Friday that EU leaders should not make sweeping decisions on migration before next year's European Parliament elections. Hungary's forint eased 0.1 percent against the euro by 0902 GMT, just like the zloty and the leu , while regional stock markets were mixed. The region's currencies are still near the 2-month highs they reached by early this week as investors chose Central European currencies and bonds instead of other emerging markets, which were hit by jitters, like Russia and Turkey. The dinar firmed slightly to 118.05 ahead of an auction of 3-year Serbian government bonds. Auctions this year often buoyed the dinar which has also been strengthened by increased demand for lending, FDI inflows and robust exports. The Serbian central bank repeatedly sold the currency which remains resistant even though the bank last week surprised at its second consecutive rate-setting meeting by reducing its benchmark rate. \"Although market demand at the debt auction is likely to be good, strong RSD may raise more concerns with the regulator (central bank) so a possibility of FX interventions should not be ruled out,\" Raiffeisen analyst Gintaras Shlizhyus said in a note.

Then, we will describe each entity in detail, including its role, attributes, relationships, and any notable actions or events. Next, we will identify relationships between the entities, describing the nature of the relationship, its impact, and any relevant historical or contextual information. We will also include direct and higher-order relationships, ensuring that the \"src_id\" and \"tgt_id\" fields match the entity names exactly.

      "\u001b[32mReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the entities_relationships. We will first identify all entities in the text that match the provided entity types. Then, we will describe each entity in detail, including its role, attributes, relationships, and any notable actions or events. Next, we will identify relationships between the entities, describing the nature of the relationship, its impact, and any relevant historical or contextual information. We will also include direct and higher-order relationships, ensuring that the \"src_id\" and \"tgt_id\" fields match the entity names exactly. Finally, we will compile all this information into a single JSON object following the specified schema.\n",

      "Receives FDA 510(k) clearance for laparoscopic inguinal hernia and laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures\n",
      "Doubles total addressable market in the U.S. to over three million annual procedures\n",
      "RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- TransEnterix, Inc. (NYSE American:TRXC), a medical device company that is digitizing the interface between the surgeon and the patient to improve minimally invasive surgery, today announced that the Company has received FDA 510(k) clearance for expanded indications of its Senhance Surgical System.\n",
      "The Company received FDA 510(k) clearance for laparoscopic inguinal hernia and laparoscopic cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) surgery. There are approximately 760,000 inguinal hernia and 1.2 million laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures performed annually in the U.S. With this clearance, Senhance System's total addressable annual procedures in the U.S. has more than doubled to over three million.\n",
      "“This indication expansion immediately doubles the addressable market for Senhance in the US and validates our regulatory strategy to successfully add to our indications for use,” said Todd M. Pope, president and chief executive officer of TransEnterix. “These expanded procedures are commonly performed at over 95% of hospitals in the United States. We believe this indication expansion will significantly increase the applicability of Senhance to more institutions, particularly those with a busy general surgery practice.”\n",
      "In the U.S., Senhance is now cleared for laparoscopic colorectal, gynecologic, inguinal hernia and cholecystectomy surgery. This enables Senhance to be used for some of the most common abdominal surgeries, including procedures in general surgery and gynecology.\n",
      "“We have utilized Senhance broadly across a wide range of general surgery, upper GI surgery and colorectal procedures at our institution,” said Professor Dr. Frank Willeke, Chief of Surgery at St. Marien Hospital in Siegen, Germany. “We believe this procedural expansion for the US will allow surgeons there to incorporate the Senhance, as we have, as a highly-efficient, enabling and very promising technology that can impact the vast majority of surgeries commonly performed by general surgeons and their sub-specialties.”\n",
      "About TransEnterix\n",

      "Input Text: * Polish, Hungarian bonds track steepening Bund yield curve * Investors ignore Hungarian wage data, CEE tension with Brussels * Serbia's 2021-expiry bond auction seen drawing strong demand By Sandor Peto BUDAPEST, April 20 (Reuters) - Long-term yields in some Central European markets tracked a rise in euro zone peers on Friday, while a 3-year bond auction in Serbia was expected to draw strong demand. Germany's 10-year bond yield rose to an almost 5-week high as a surge in oil prices increased inflation expectations. Polish and Hungarian bonds tracked a steepening Bund yield curve. Poland's 10-year yield rose 2 basis points (bps) from Thursday's close to 3.061, and Hungary's equivalent yield, at 2.49 percent, was 3 bps above Thursday's fixing. Hungary's advance was not linked with either gross wages data which again showed double-digit annual growth or new comments from Prime Minister Viktor Orban highlighting tension with Brussels, market participants said. The surge in wages is unlikely to boost inflation in the short term and lead to less loose central bank policy, analysts said. Markets continue to ignore an East-West divide in the European Union over differences in views about immigration and the role of national governments, one Budapest-based fixed income trader said. \"We are yet to see if the jostling turns into a street fight,\" the trader said. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Friday that EU leaders should not make sweeping decisions on migration before next year's European Parliament elections. Hungary's forint eased 0.1 percent against the euro by 0902 GMT, just like the zloty and the leu , while regional stock markets were mixed. The region's currencies are still near the 2-month highs they reached by early this week as investors chose Central European currencies and bonds instead of other emerging markets, which were hit by jitters, like Russia and Turkey. The dinar firmed slightly to 118.05 ahead of an auction of 3-year Serbian government bonds. Auctions this year often buoyed the dinar which has also been strengthened by increased demand for lending, FDI inflows and robust exports. The Serbian central bank repeatedly sold the currency which remains resistant even though the bank last week surprised at its second consecutive rate-setting meeting by reducing its benchmark rate. \"Although market demand at the debt auction is likely to be good, strong RSD may raise more concerns with the regulator (central bank) so a possibility of FX interventions should not be ruled out,\" Raiffeisen analyst Gintaras Shlizhyus said in a note.

      "RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- TransEnterix, Inc. (NYSE American:TRXC), a medical device company that is digitizing the interface between the surgeon and the patient to improve minimally invasive surgery, today announced that the Company has received FDA 510(k) clearance for expanded indications of its Senhance Surgical System.\n",
      "The Company received FDA 510(k) clearance for laparoscopic inguinal hernia and laparoscopic cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) surgery. There are approximately 760,000 inguinal hernia and 1.2 million laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures performed annually in the U.S. With this clearance, Senhance System's total addressable annual procedures in the U.S. has more than doubled to over three million.\n",
      "“This indication expansion immediately doubles the addressable market for Senhance in the US and validates our regulatory strategy to successfully add to our indications for use,” said Todd M. Pope, president and chief executive officer of TransEnterix. “These expanded procedures are commonly performed at over 95% of hospitals in the United States. We believe this indication expansion will significantly increase the applicability of Senhance to more institutions, particularly those with a busy general surgery practice.”\n",
      "In the U.S., Senhance is now cleared for laparoscopic colorectal, gynecologic, inguinal hernia and cholecystectomy surgery. This enables Senhance to be used for some of the most common abdominal surgeries, including procedures in general surgery and gynecology.\n",
      "“We have utilized Senhance broadly across a wide range of general surgery, upper GI surgery and colorectal procedures at our institution,” said Professor Dr. Frank Willeke, Chief of Surgery at St. Marien Hospital in Siegen, Germany. “We believe this procedural expansion for the US will allow surgeons there to incorporate the Senhance, as we have, as a highly-efficient, enabling and very promising technology that can impact the vast majority of surgeries commonly performed by general surgeons and their sub-specialties.”\n",

      "Input Text: * Polish, Hungarian bonds track steepening Bund yield curve * Investors ignore Hungarian wage data, CEE tension with Brussels * Serbia's 2021-expiry bond auction seen drawing strong demand By Sandor Peto BUDAPEST, April 20 (Reuters) - Long-term yields in some Central European markets tracked a rise in euro zone peers on Friday, while a 3-year bond auction in Serbia was expected to draw strong demand. Germany's 10-year bond yield rose to an almost 5-week high as a surge in oil prices increased inflation expectations. Polish and Hungarian bonds tracked a steepening Bund yield curve. Poland's 10-year yield rose 2 basis points (bps) from Thursday's close to 3.061, and Hungary's equivalent yield, at 2.49 percent, was 3 bps above Thursday's fixing. Hungary's advance was not linked with either gross wages data which again showed double-digit annual growth or new comments from Prime Minister Viktor Orban highlighting tension with Brussels, market participants said. The surge in wages is unlikely to boost inflation in the short term and lead to less loose central bank policy, analysts said. Markets continue to ignore an East-West divide in the European Union over differences in views about immigration and the role of national governments, one Budapest-based fixed income trader said. \"We are yet to see if the jostling turns into a street fight,\" the trader said. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Friday that EU leaders should not make sweeping decisions on migration before next year's European Parliament elections. Hungary's forint eased 0.1 percent against the euro by 0902 GMT, just like the zloty and the leu , while regional stock markets were mixed. The region's currencies are still near the 2-month highs they reached by early this week as investors chose Central European currencies and bonds instead of other emerging markets, which were hit by jitters, like Russia and Turkey. The dinar firmed slightly to 118.05 ahead of an auction of 3-year Serbian government bonds. Auctions this year often buoyed the dinar which has also been strengthened by increased demand for lending, FDI inflows and robust exports. The Serbian central bank repeatedly sold the currency which remains resistant even though the bank last week surprised at its second consecutive rate-setting meeting by reducing its benchmark rate. \"Although market demand at the debt auction is likely to be good, strong RSD may raise more concerns with the regulator (central bank) so a possibility of FX interventions should not be ruled out,\" Raiffeisen analyst Gintaras Shlizhyus said in a note.

      "RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- TransEnterix, Inc. (NYSE American:TRXC), a medical device company that is digitizing the interface between the surgeon and the patient to improve minimally invasive surgery, today announced that the Company has received FDA 510(k) clearance for expanded indications of its Senhance Surgical System.\n",
      "The Company received FDA 510(k) clearance for laparoscopic inguinal hernia and laparoscopic cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) surgery. There are approximately 760,000 inguinal hernia and 1.2 million laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures performed annually in the U.S. With this clearance, Senhance System's total addressable annual procedures in the U.S. has more than doubled to over three million.\n",
      "“This indication expansion immediately doubles the addressable market for Senhance in the US and validates our regulatory strategy to successfully add to our indications for use,” said Todd M. Pope, president and chief executive officer of TransEnterix. “These expanded procedures are commonly performed at over 95% of hospitals in the United States. We believe this indication expansion will significantly increase the applicability of Senhance to more institutions, particularly those with a busy general surgery practice.”\n",
      "In the U.S., Senhance is now cleared for laparoscopic colorectal, gynecologic, inguinal hernia and cholecystectomy surgery. This enables Senhance to be used for some of the most common abdominal surgeries, including procedures in general surgery and gynecology.\n",
      "“We have utilized Senhance broadly across a wide range of general surgery, upper GI surgery and colorectal procedures at our institution,” said Professor Dr. Frank Willeke, Chief of Surgery at St. Marien Hospital in Siegen, Germany. “We believe this procedural expansion for the US will allow surgeons there to incorporate the Senhance, as we have, as a highly-efficient, enabling and very promising technology that can impact the vast majority of surgeries commonly performed by general surgeons and their sub-specialties.”\n",
      "About TransEnterix\n",

      "Input Text: * Polish, Hungarian bonds track steepening Bund yield curve * Investors ignore Hungarian wage data, CEE tension with Brussels * Serbia's 2021-expiry bond auction seen drawing strong demand By Sandor Peto BUDAPEST, April 20 (Reuters) - Long-term yields in some Central European markets tracked a rise in euro zone peers on Friday, while a 3-year bond auction in Serbia was expected to draw strong demand. Germany's 10-year bond yield rose to an almost 5-week high as a surge in oil prices increased inflation expectations. Polish and Hungarian bonds tracked a steepening Bund yield curve. Poland's 10-year yield rose 2 basis points (bps) from Thursday's close to 3.061, and Hungary's equivalent yield, at 2.49 percent, was 3 bps above Thursday's fixing. Hungary's advance was not linked with either gross wages data which again showed double-digit annual growth or new comments from Prime Minister Viktor Orban highlighting tension with Brussels, market participants said. The surge in wages is unlikely to boost inflation in the short term and lead to less loose central bank policy, analysts said. Markets continue to ignore an East-West divide in the European Union over differences in views about immigration and the role of national governments, one Budapest-based fixed income trader said. \"We are yet to see if the jostling turns into a street fight,\" the trader said. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Friday that EU leaders should not make sweeping decisions on migration before next year's European Parliament elections. Hungary's forint eased 0.1 percent against the euro by 0902 GMT, just like the zloty and the leu , while regional stock markets were mixed. The region's currencies are still near the 2-month highs they reached by early this week as investors chose Central European currencies and bonds instead of other emerging markets, which were hit by jitters, like Russia and Turkey. The dinar firmed slightly to 118.05 ahead of an auction of 3-year Serbian government bonds. Auctions this year often buoyed the dinar which has also been strengthened by increased demand for lending, FDI inflows and robust exports. The Serbian central bank repeatedly sold the currency which remains resistant even though the bank last week surprised at its second consecutive rate-setting meeting by reducing its benchmark rate. \"Although market demand at the debt auction is likely to be good, strong RSD may raise more concerns with the regulator (central bank) so a possibility of FX interventions should not be ruled out,\" Raiffeisen analyst Gintaras Shlizhyus said in a note.

      "Doubles total addressable market in the U.S. to over three million annual procedures\n",
      "RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- TransEnterix, Inc. (NYSE American:TRXC), a medical device company that is digitizing the interface between the surgeon and the patient to improve minimally invasive surgery, today announced that the Company has received FDA 510(k) clearance for expanded indications of its Senhance Surgical System.\n",
      "The Company received FDA 510(k) clearance for laparoscopic inguinal hernia and laparoscopic cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) surgery. There are approximately 760,000 inguinal hernia and 1.2 million laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures performed annually in the U.S. With this clearance, Senhance System's total addressable annual procedures in the U.S. has more than doubled to over three million.\n",
      "“This indication expansion immediately doubles the addressable market for Senhance in the US and validates our regulatory strategy to successfully add to our indications for use,” said Todd M. Pope, president and chief executive officer of TransEnterix. “These expanded procedures are commonly performed at over 95% of hospitals in the United States. We believe this indication expansion will significantly increase the applicability of Senhance to more institutions, particularly those with a busy general surgery practice.”\n",
      "In the U.S., Senhance is now cleared for laparoscopic colorectal, gynecologic, inguinal hernia and cholecystectomy surgery. This enables Senhance to be used for some of the most common abdominal surgeries, including procedures in general surgery and gynecology.\n",
      "“We have utilized Senhance broadly across a wide range of general surgery, upper GI surgery and colorectal procedures at our institution,” said Professor Dr. Frank Willeke, Chief of Surgery at St. Marien Hospital in Siegen, Germany. “We believe this procedural expansion for the US will allow surgeons there to incorporate the Senhance, as we have, as a highly-efficient, enabling and very promising technology that can impact the vast majority of surgeries commonly performed by general surgeons and their sub-specialties.”\n",
      "About TransEnterix\n",

      "Input Text: * Polish, Hungarian bonds track steepening Bund yield curve * Investors ignore Hungarian wage data, CEE tension with Brussels * Serbia's 2021-expiry bond auction seen drawing strong demand By Sandor Peto BUDAPEST, April 20 (Reuters) - Long-term yields in some Central European markets tracked a rise in euro zone peers on Friday, while a 3-year bond auction in Serbia was expected to draw strong demand. Germany's 10-year bond yield rose to an almost 5-week high as a surge in oil prices increased inflation expectations. Polish and Hungarian bonds tracked a steepening Bund yield curve. Poland's 10-year yield rose 2 basis points (bps) from Thursday's close to 3.061, and Hungary's equivalent yield, at 2.49 percent, was 3 bps above Thursday's fixing. Hungary's advance was not linked with either gross wages data which again showed double-digit annual growth or new comments from Prime Minister Viktor Orban highlighting tension with Brussels, market participants said. The surge in wages is unlikely to boost inflation in the short term and lead to less loose central bank policy, analysts said. Markets continue to ignore an East-West divide in the European Union over differences in views about immigration and the role of national governments, one Budapest-based fixed income trader said. \"We are yet to see if the jostling turns into a street fight,\" the trader said. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Friday that EU leaders should not make sweeping decisions on migration before next year's European Parliament elections. Hungary's forint eased 0.1 percent against the euro by 0902 GMT, just like the zloty and the leu , while regional stock markets were mixed. The region's currencies are still near the 2-month highs they reached by early this week as investors chose Central European currencies and bonds instead of other emerging markets, which were hit by jitters, like Russia and Turkey. The dinar firmed slightly to 118.05 ahead of an auction of 3-year Serbian government bonds. Auctions this year often buoyed the dinar which has also been strengthened by increased demand for lending, FDI inflows and robust exports. The Serbian central bank repeatedly sold the currency which remains resistant even though the bank last week surprised at its second consecutive rate-setting meeting by reducing its benchmark rate. \"Although market demand at the debt auction is likely to be good, strong RSD may raise more concerns with the regulator (central bank) so a possibility of FX interventions should not be ruled out,\" Raiffeisen analyst Gintaras Shlizhyus said in a note.

      "Doubles total addressable market in the U.S. to over three million annual procedures\n",
      "RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- TransEnterix, Inc. (NYSE American:TRXC), a medical device company that is digitizing the interface between the surgeon and the patient to improve minimally invasive surgery, today announced that the Company has received FDA 510(k) clearance for expanded indications of its Senhance Surgical System.\n",
      "The Company received FDA 510(k) clearance for laparoscopic inguinal hernia and laparoscopic cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) surgery. There are approximately 760,000 inguinal hernia and 1.2 million laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures performed annually in the U.S. With this clearance, Senhance System's total addressable annual procedures in the U.S. has more than doubled to over three million.\n",
      "“This indication expansion immediately doubles the addressable market for Senhance in the US and validates our regulatory strategy to successfully add to our indications for use,” said Todd M. Pope, president and chief executive officer of TransEnterix. “These expanded procedures are commonly performed at over 95% of hospitals in the United States. We believe this indication expansion will significantly increase the applicability of Senhance to more institutions, particularly those with a busy general surgery practice.”\n",
      "In the U.S., Senhance is now cleared for laparoscopic colorectal, gynecologic, inguinal hernia and cholecystectomy surgery. This enables Senhance to be used for some of the most common abdominal surgeries, including procedures in general surgery and gynecology.\n",
      "“We have utilized Senhance broadly across a wide range of general surgery, upper GI surgery and colorectal procedures at our institution,” said Professor Dr. Frank Willeke, Chief of Surgery at St. Marien Hospital in Siegen, Germany. “We believe this procedural expansion for the US will allow surgeons there to incorporate the Senhance, as we have, as a highly-efficient, enabling and very promising technology that can impact the vast majority of surgeries commonly performed by general surgeons and their sub-specialties.”\n",
      "About TransEnterix\n",

      "Input Text: * Polish, Hungarian bonds track steepening Bund yield curve * Investors ignore Hungarian wage data, CEE tension with Brussels * Serbia's 2021-expiry bond auction seen drawing strong demand By Sandor Peto BUDAPEST, April 20 (Reuters) - Long-term yields in some Central European markets tracked a rise in euro zone peers on Friday, while a 3-year bond auction in Serbia was expected to draw strong demand. Germany's 10-year bond yield rose to an almost 5-week high as a surge in oil prices increased inflation expectations. Polish and Hungarian bonds tracked a steepening Bund yield curve. Poland's 10-year yield rose 2 basis points (bps) from Thursday's close to 3.061, and Hungary's equivalent yield, at 2.49 percent, was 3 bps above Thursday's fixing. Hungary's advance was not linked with either gross wages data which again showed double-digit annual growth or new comments from Prime Minister Viktor Orban highlighting tension with Brussels, market participants said. The surge in wages is unlikely to boost inflation in the short term and lead to less loose central bank policy, analysts said. Markets continue to ignore an East-West divide in the European Union over differences in views about immigration and the role of national governments, one Budapest-based fixed income trader said. \"We are yet to see if the jostling turns into a street fight,\" the trader said. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Friday that EU leaders should not make sweeping decisions on migration before next year's European Parliament elections. Hungary's forint eased 0.1 percent against the euro by 0902 GMT, just like the zloty and the leu , while regional stock markets were mixed. The region's currencies are still near the 2-month highs they reached by early this week as investors chose Central European currencies and bonds instead of other emerging markets, which were hit by jitters, like Russia and Turkey. The dinar firmed slightly to 118.05 ahead of an auction of 3-year Serbian government bonds. Auctions this year often buoyed the dinar which has also been strengthened by increased demand for lending, FDI inflows and robust exports. The Serbian central bank repeatedly sold the currency which remains resistant even though the bank last week surprised at its second consecutive rate-setting meeting by reducing its benchmark rate. \"Although market demand at the debt auction is likely to be good, strong RSD may raise more concerns with the regulator (central bank) so a possibility of FX interventions should not be ruled out,\" Raiffeisen analyst Gintaras Shlizhyus said in a note.

We believe this indication expansion will significantly increase the applicability of Senhance to more institutions, particularly those with a busy general surgery practice.”\\nIn the U.S., Senhance is now cleared for laparoscopic colorectal, gynecologic, inguinal hernia and cholecystectomy surgery. This enables Senhance to be used for some of the most common abdominal surgeries, including procedures in general surgery and gynecology.\\n“We have utilized Senhance broadly across a wide range of general surgery, upper GI surgery and colorectal procedures at our institution,” said Professor Dr. Frank Willeke, Chief of Surgery at St. Marien Hospital in Siegen, Germany. “We believe this procedural expansion for the US will allow surgeons there to incorporate the Senhance, as we have, as a highly-efficient, enabling and very promising technology that can impact the vast majority of surgeries commonly performed by general surgeons and their sub-specialties.”\\nAbout TransEnterix\\nTransEnterix is a medical device company that is digitizing the interface between the surgeon and the patient to improve minimally invasive surgery by addressing the clinical and economic challenges associated with current laparoscopic and robotic options in today\\'s value-based healthcare environment.

Germany\\'s 10-year bond yield rose to an almost 5-week high as a surge in oil prices increased inflation expectations. Polish and Hungarian bonds tracked a steepening Bund yield curve. Poland\\'s 10-year yield rose 2 basis points (bps) from Thursday\\'s close to 3.061, and Hungary\\'s equivalent yield, at 2.49 percent, was 3 bps above Thursday\\'s fixing. Hungary\\'s advance was not linked with either gross wages data which again showed double-digit annual growth or new comments from Prime Minister Viktor Orban highlighting tension with Brussels, market participants said. The surge in wages is unlikely to boost inflation in the short term and lead to less loose central bank policy, analysts said. Markets continue to ignore an East-West divide in the European Union over differences in views about immigration and the role of national governments, one Budapest-based fixed income trader said. \"We are yet to see if the jostling turns into a street fight,\" the trader said. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Friday that EU leaders should not make sweeping decisions on migration before next year\\'s European Parliament elections. Hungary\\'s forint eased 0.1 percent against the euro by 0902 GMT, just like the zloty and the leu , while regional stock markets were mixed. The region\\'s currencies are still near the 2-month highs they reached by early this week as investors chose Central European currencies and bonds instead of other emerging markets, which were hit by jitters, like Russia and Turkey. The dinar firmed slightly to 118.05 ahead of an auction of 3-year Serbian government bonds. Auctions this year often buoyed the dinar which has also been strengthened by increased demand for lending, FDI inflows and robust exports. The Serbian central bank repeatedly sold the currency which remains resistant even though the bank last week surprised at its second consecutive rate-setting meeting by reducing its benchmark rate. \"Although market demand at the debt auction is likely to be good, strong RSD may raise more concerns with the regulator (central bank) so a possibility of FX interventions should not be ruled out,\" Raiffeisen analyst Gintaras Shlizhyus said in a note.

We will first identify all entities in the text that match the provided entity types. Then, we will describe each entity in detail, including its role, attributes, relationships, and any notable actions or events. Next, we will identify relationships between the entities, describing the nature of the relationship, its impact, and any relevant historical or contextual information. We will also include direct and higher-order relationships, ensuring that the \"src_id\" and \"tgt_id\" fields match the entity names exactly.
