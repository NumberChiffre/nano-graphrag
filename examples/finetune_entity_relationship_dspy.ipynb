Students galvanized by the deadly mass shooting at the Florida high school confronted lawmakers with demands to restrict sales of assault rifles, while President Donald Trump suggested arming teachers as a way to stop more U.S. rampages.\\nTwo weeks before a gunman fatally shot 17 people at a Florida high school, Bill Lee, the president of the state’s school administrators association, warned that Florida’s schools were vulnerable to just such an attack. “It’s not a matter of if, but when,” he wrote in the Orlando Sentinel on Jan. 29, calling on legislators to increase school security spending after two January school shootings in other states.\\nWorld\\nU.S. players pose for a photo as they celebrate their victory over Canada.

The real strategic winner, however, is the South Korean government, which has shrewdly used the games to reshape the diplomatic landscape.”\\nBusiness\\nLast March, executives at General Electric's power-plant business gave Wall Street a surprisingly bullish forecast for the year. Despite flat demand for new natural gas power plants, they said, GE Power’s revenue and profit would rise.

(NYSE American:TRXC), a medical device company that is digitizing the interface between the surgeon and the patient to improve minimally invasive surgery, today announced that the Company has received FDA 510(k) clearance for expanded indications of its Senhance Surgical System.\\nThe Company received FDA 510(k) clearance for laparoscopic inguinal hernia and laparoscopic cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) surgery. There are approximately 760,000 inguinal hernia and 1.2 million laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures performed annually in the U.S. With this clearance, Senhance System\\'s total addressable annual procedures in the U.S. has more than doubled to over three million.\\n“This indication expansion immediately doubles the addressable market for Senhance in the US and validates our regulatory strategy to successfully add to our indications for use,” said Todd M. Pope, president and chief executive officer of TransEnterix. “These expanded procedures are commonly performed at over 95% of hospitals in the United States. We believe this indication expansion will significantly increase the applicability of Senhance to more institutions, particularly those with a busy general surgery practice.”\\nIn the U.S., Senhance is now cleared for laparoscopic colorectal, gynecologic, inguinal hernia and cholecystectomy surgery. This enables Senhance to be used for some of the most common abdominal surgeries, including procedures in general surgery and gynecology.\\n“We have utilized Senhance broadly across a wide range of general surgery, upper GI surgery and colorectal procedures at our institution,” said Professor Dr. Frank Willeke, Chief of Surgery at St. Marien Hospital in Siegen, Germany. “We believe this procedural expansion for the US will allow surgeons there to incorporate the Senhance, as we have, as a highly-efficient, enabling and very promising technology that can impact the vast majority of surgeries commonly performed by general surgeons and their sub-specialties.”\\nAbout TransEnterix\\nTransEnterix is a medical device company that is digitizing the interface between the surgeon and the patient to improve minimally invasive surgery by addressing the clinical and economic challenges associated with current laparoscopic and robotic options in today\\'s value-based healthcare environment. The Company is focused on the commercialization of the Senhance Surgical System, which digitizes laparoscopic minimally invasive surgery.

       " Example({'input_text': '* Polish, Hungarian bonds track steepening Bund yield curve * Investors ignore Hungarian wage data, CEE tension with Brussels * Serbia\\'s 2021-expiry bond auction seen drawing strong demand By Sandor Peto BUDAPEST, April 20 (Reuters) - Long-term yields in some Central European markets tracked a rise in euro zone peers on Friday, while a 3-year bond auction in Serbia was expected to draw strong demand. Germany\\'s 10-year bond yield rose to an almost 5-week high as a surge in oil prices increased inflation expectations. Polish and Hungarian bonds tracked a steepening Bund yield curve. Poland\\'s 10-year yield rose 2 basis points (bps) from Thursday\\'s close to 3.061, and Hungary\\'s equivalent yield, at 2.49 percent, was 3 bps above Thursday\\'s fixing. Hungary\\'s advance was not linked with either gross wages data which again showed double-digit annual growth or new comments from Prime Minister Viktor Orban highlighting tension with Brussels, market participants said. The surge in wages is unlikely to boost inflation in the short term and lead to less loose central bank policy, analysts said. Markets continue to ignore an East-West divide in the European Union over differences in views about immigration and the role of national governments, one Budapest-based fixed income trader said. \"We are yet to see if the jostling turns into a street fight,\" the trader said. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Friday that EU leaders should not make sweeping decisions on migration before next year\\'s European Parliament elections. Hungary\\'s forint eased 0.1 percent against the euro by 0902 GMT, just like the zloty and the leu , while regional stock markets were mixed. The region\\'s currencies are still near the 2-month highs they reached by early this week as investors chose Central European currencies and bonds instead of other emerging markets, which were hit by jitters, like Russia and Turkey. The dinar firmed slightly to 118.05 ahead of an auction of 3-year Serbian government bonds. Auctions this year often buoyed the dinar which has also been strengthened by increased demand for lending, FDI inflows and robust exports. The Serbian central bank repeatedly sold the currency which remains resistant even though the bank last week surprised at its second consecutive rate-setting meeting by reducing its benchmark rate. \"Although market demand at the debt auction is likely to be good, strong RSD may raise more concerns with the regulator (central bank) so a possibility of FX interventions should not be ruled out,\" Raiffeisen analyst Gintaras Shlizhyus said in a note.

I don\\'t have a specific policy announcement on that front, but I think we\\'re all looking forward to that testimony.\\nRepublicans are generally against more corporate regulation and they are not persuaded that tech companies need more of it. I dont want to hurt Facebook. I dont want to regulate them half to death, said Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana, a member of the Judiciary Committee But we have a problem. Our promised digital utopia has minefields in it.\\nCompanies that have been victimized by computer hacks have been accused by lawmakers of failing to take adequate security measures to protect their customers\\' personal information.\\nSenior executives from a host of companies including Target Corp, Alphabet\\'s Google, United Airlines and Equifax, have testified before Congress on a variety of issues including network security and walked away with little more than a scolding and a temporary dip in stock price.\\nPowerful lobbying forces assemble against any effort to convert public and political outrage into regulation, privacy advocates have said. Facebook spent $1.35 million on lobbying in 2011 and six years later spent $11.5 million, according to data maintained by the Center for Responsive Politics.\\n\"People have this idea that we are going to pass omnibus privacy legislation and it is going to be a silver bullet,\" said Alvaro Bedoya, a former congressional aide who worked on privacy issues for former Senator Al Franken. \"The reality is lobbyists outnumber consumer privacy advocates in Washington 20 to 1 or 30 to 1.\"\\nInstead of major regulatory changes, lawmakers in Congress have offered narrowly focused legislation.\\nThe Honest Ads Act, for instance, aims to address concerns about foreign nationals covertly purchasing ads on social media to influence American politics. It would require political ads on the internet to reveal who paid for them, much the same as ads on television and radio. It legislation has been stalled since its introduction last October, although Facebook endorsed it on Friday.\\nCongress did pass legislation last month that chipped away at the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which for decades has guarded internet-based companies from liability for what users post on their platforms.\\nThe legislation, which is expected to be signed into law this week by U.S. President Donald Trump, was aimed at penalizing operators of websites that facilitate online sex trafficking. Internet companies have expressed worry that it could be the first step toward dismantling decades of a hands-off regulatory approach by Washington.\\nTechnology industry officials said they also expected Zuckerberg\\'s testimony to be long on political point scoring and short on legislative ideas.\\n\"They don\\'t understand ad targeting and they will probably ask him a bunch of unrelated questions that play to their respective political bases,\" said one technology industry source, who spoke on condition on anonymity because his company had not authorized him to speak on the matter for the record.\\n\"So Democrats will ask about monopolies and Republicans will ask about anti-conservative bias in Silicon Valley.\" (Reporting by Dustin Volz in Washington Additional reporting by David Ingram, David Shepardson and Amanda Becker)', 'entities': [{'entity_name': 'MARK ZUCKERBERG', 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'description': \"Facebook Chief Executive, scheduled to testify before the Senate Commerce and Judiciary Committees.

Around 75 percent of its leather goods now cost just under 1,000 pounds ($1,400), or less.\\nIn spite of a tougher balancing act on costs, Mulberry was “fully, fully committed” to Britain, Andretta added, speaking on Monday.\\nThe label - whose bags have been sported by celebrities including Prince Harry’s fiancee, actress Meghan Markle - trades off its UK heritage and the skills of its craftsmen.\\n“We want to continue this and I hope one day when we grow perhaps we will even consider opening another factory,” said Andretta, who used to run Italian fine jewellers Buccellati and has worked at labels like LVMH’s Celine.\\nManufacturing bases outside Britain include Italy and Spain.\\nDIGITAL GENERATION The brand is expanding sales overseas, branching into Japan with a partner.\\nMulberry’s like-for-like retail sales, which compares stores that have been trading for a year or more, were down 1 percent in the United Kingdom in the six months to end-September and fell 3 percent overseas in that period. But international revenue growth sped up thereafter.\\nThe label, majority-owned by Singapore billionaires Christina Ong and Ong Beng Seng, will roll out a China-based distribution centre later in 2018 to help it expand online shopping and speed up deliveries, Andretta said.\\nRevived spending from Chinese consumers, who account for around a third of luxury goods purchases worldwide, fuelled strong revenue growth at industry leaders like Louis Vuitton owner LVMH in 2017.\\nMulberry is also trying to capture a younger clientele with updated designs and strategies. From February, its catwalk collections will be instantly available, rather than months later as is usual.\\nNew designs like the Amberley bag and a revamped version of the brand’s classic Bayswater are now among bestsellers, Andretta said.\\n“We are growing strongly with the digital generation,” Andretta said.
